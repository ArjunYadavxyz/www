<h1 class="title">
  Need of Strongman
</h1>
<p class="subtitle"><strong>2024-05-01</strong></p>
<p>Yes Github I would like to file a bug report for the people from eastern countries. I don't know if you have noticed this before or not, but I have found this weird phenomenon where people from east for some reason want to see there leaders living in a 'gangsters paradise'. To reproduce this bug follow the steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Go to YouTube.com</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol start="2">
<li>Search of any President/Prime Minister/King's name from a eastern country + the term 'gangster's paradise'. For instance, let's search for &quot;Putin gangster's paradise&quot;.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol start="3">
<li>You might be greeted with lot of Putin's gangster paradise videos. They are nothing but the random (or staged video) of Putin with Gangster Paradise song playing in background.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol start="4">
<li>Interestingly enough, judging from the views and comments, apparently people cherish to see these type of videos.
(Pic comes here)</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>See for instance these sample videos which are just handful of many which can be found on YouTube which showcase how much people from east love strong leaders (at their portrayal as strong leaders):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In Pakistan, for some reason they use the word 'protocol' instead of 'gangster's paradise'. However, the need is unchanged i.e to see their leader moving in expensive cars and guards which are paid by taxpayer's money. What is funny about these edited videos from Pakistan is that the 'protocol' of the strongman usually has imported Toyota cars with punjabi songs playing in the background.:</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this phenemenon or b
I must make it clear that I don't know if it is an actual bug or intended feature of the eastern country's demography.</p>
