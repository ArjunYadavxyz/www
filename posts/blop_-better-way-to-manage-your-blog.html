<p>When you have made a simple blog website built up of pure html and css like mine. You will find it consuming lot of time just to constantly update your blog list on the website. And sooner or later you will be encountered by something called <a href="https://jamstack.org/generators/">static site generators</a>. Although ssg’s like Hugo are really famous and lot of people use them, they still contain 100 things out of which the users only use 2. Also at times big ssg’s can be quite complicated to use. I spent two days trying to make a static blog site with multiple ssg’s but if failed at understanding how they actually work. But after doing some search i came across [blop] (https://gitlab.com/uoou/blop/-/tree/master).</p>
<p>Blop is simply a bash script made by [uoou] (https://friendo.monster/) which creates a static website from markdown files. It is simple and customisable. (However I’ve still not figured out how to create multiple blog list)</p>
<h3 id="steps-to-make-your-static-blog-using-blop">Steps to make your static blog using Blop:</h3>
<p>1- Download zip file of the example site from [this] (https://gitlab.com/uoou/blop_blog/tree/master/public) repository and unzip it. We are downloading the example site instead of making each file ourselves is that everything in example site is customisable and will be more efficient to change that example site than making everything ourselves.</p>
<p>2- Now as we have downloaded and unzipped the example site we can move to download Blop from [this] (https://gitlab.com/uoou/blop/-/tree/master) repository. unzip the file and paste blop in your $PATH directory or just paste the blop in your example site folder if you don’t know what $PATH is.</p>
<p>3- After doing step one and two your example site folder should look like this:</p>
<center>
<p><a href=../pix/Blop3.png><img width="500" height="300" src="../pix/Blop3.png" alt="Blop"></a></p>
<p>4- Open terminal in folder and make blop executable by running the command <code>chomd +x blop</code></p>
<p>5- Now everything is ready to make our static site. But still files in current directory is from example site. You can click on index.html to see example site. But you can also edit ‘index_template.html’ (this is template for your index.html) similarly ‘archive_template.html’ is template for your blog list and ‘post_template.html’ is template for your blog post. You might also like to change ‘style.css’</p>
<p>6- When you are done with editing different templates the next step is to add your own post. In order to do this you have to delete all markdown files from the markdown folder (This folder includes .md of all your posts) and add your own .md files. Believe me markdown is more efficient to use than html. note that markdown can be limiting when you are working with images (Like setting width and height of images) in that case you can use ‘img’ tag of html in .md files and blop will without any problem convert them into html.</p>
<p>Moreover, If you are trying to move your previously written blog to blop you can directly add you old html blog files in markdown folder and Blop will still work. However Blop will mess your blog publish dates. (i don’t know its solution if you do then please share it with me)</p>
<p>7- Now comes the ‘image’ folder, you can rename it to whatever you want, Blop won’t mess up with it.</p>
<p>8- Run ‘blop’ in main directory. (public) Hopefully everything will be done right.</p>
<h3 id="configuring-site.config">Configuring site.config</h3>
<p>By default sight.config will look like this:</p>
<p>‘max_posts: 11 listing_format: <a href="posts/<!--title-nospaces-->.html"><!--title--></a> <em>by</em> <!--author--> <em>on</em> <!--date--> default_author: Skairipa’</p>
<p>1- Here ‘max post’ means the number of posts will be shown on ‘index.html’ you can change 11 to 4,3,5 etc.</p>
<p>2- In ‘listing format’ you can remove ‘<em>by</em> <!--author-->’ to remove your name from repeating after every blog post as it is obvious tht its your blog Donald Trump wont be posting on your website. (It can be useful when multiple people are making posts on your website)</p>
<p>3- Change ‘Default author’ name to yours.</p>
<p>4- Additional you can also add custom date format by adding this line: ‘date_format: %d-%m-%Y’</p>
<p>If you need help at any stage of setting up blop feel free to disturb me at me Email. And if you are good at bash and know how to add multiple <!--archive list--> to blop, do share it with me.</p>
