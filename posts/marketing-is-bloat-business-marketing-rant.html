marketing is considered to be one of the most essential part of business these days, business spend big chunk of their resources into marketing in order to fill their “sales tunnel”. most of the time the percentage of total cost spent on marketing alone is really high, And oh boy, this percentage of resource spending reaches dangerous heights when we analyse it in monopolistic competition.
</p>
<p>
I’m going to ask three questions-<br/> 1- why spend on marketing?<br/> 2- who actually pays for the increased marketing coasts?<br/> 3-Alternative to spending on business marketing department?
</p>
<p>
1- why spend on marketing? Well easy question, businesses spend on marketing in order to create public awareness about their commodity, if more people know about their commodities more people will be interested in buying their commodities, if more people are buying their commodities the owners will take more money to their homes. As competition in some market increase things become even worse now spend more on marketing or get out of business. but this is only free hand side of marketing, it has some consequences as well. Spending on marketing activity increases the overall production cost!!!!
</p>
<p>
2- who pays for this increased marketing cost? You and me, we the consumers have to pay for this increased overall production cost. We like to blame inflation for increased prices but what about those stupid costs which are incurred by every business which no one but the end consumer has to pay! Ok there are many things which increases the prices of things and stupid marketing costs are definitely one of them.
</p>
<p>
3-Alternative to spending on business marketing department? It’s better to increase the money on r&amp;d and real product development rather than hiring one more marketing guy! In the long run by spending more money on r&amp;d will help us to find efficient ways to build a product. It will result in decrease costs will means more profit for business!
