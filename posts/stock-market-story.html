<p>instead of directly criticizing stock market i would first share an small instance: <br/> <br/></p>
<p>himanshu a 27 years old software engineer is currently working from home because of lockdown. in that ‚Äòwork from home‚Äô he has only minimal work to do as his company is currently not engaging in it‚Äôs main operations. now our guy, himanshu is an average nice middle class worker. at home, not working, when himanshu is bored he moves his attention towards Netflix or watches cricket match on T.V. one day while watching cricket match he pays attention to an advertisement of a stock market broker. the ad can be concluded with this: a weak man who can‚Äôt even touch his toes can also trade with stocks using broker‚Äôs easy to use platform. <br/> <img src="../pix/mancan'ttouchtoe.jpg" alt="upstox" class="resmid"> <br/></p>
<p>there is also another ad of the same broker which himanshu saw: an unemployed 25 year old fat man who can‚Äôt even catch cricket ball can also trade with stocks using broker‚Äôs easy to use platform. <br/> <br/></p>
<p>himanshu thought why shouldn‚Äôt he give it a try? after all it‚Äôs easy money, he just have to buy and sell stocks and one day he will become millionaire. himanshu recalls that in his teenage he wanted to become like warren buffet, but because of family pressure he had to do engineering, now he can finally follow his passion and become next warren buffet. <br/> <br/></p>
<p>now after a long ‚Äòresearch‚Äô on YouTube himanshu finds the best broker and opens his account with a referral link which was provided by some youtuber who promoted the broker for his own incentive. poor himanshu thought that the youtuber was genuinely advicing the best broker. however, this broker is no better than the other brokers but the only thing which is good is the persuasion skills of the youtuber who advertised it. <br/> <br/></p>
<p>now as the work of opining a trading account is complete, the second work is to choose the stocks. himanshu right away refused to buy stocks of his own company as he know that the management of his company is corrupt and they will sooner or later destroy the company. so he starts looking on internet and on news to buy stocks. on news he finds some stocks which are claimed by the anchor that their value will increase more than 50% within few weeks.(just like a second hand cars salesman, that anchor was advertising the stocks. after all he has been paid to talk like that.)he finally chooses some trending stocks which everyone is buying and invests his one month salary into it. <br/> <br/></p>
<p>3 months have passed since himanshu bought those shares and now his ‚Äòinvestment‚Äô turned out to be loss. he is in tension. desperately he moves to his 30 year old brother to ask advice. he starts to whine in front of his brother ‚Äúi have invested my salary into stock market, my money is worth noting now. what should i do now please tell me brother. i didn‚Äôt know that stock market is this bad, please help me getting out of this trouble.‚Äù himanshu shared his whole story to his brother. <br/> <br/></p>
<p>brother replied: it‚Äôs not the stock market which is bad in your case. it is you who is ignorant.<br />
<br/> <br/></p>
<p>himanshu, now somewhat confused: how am i ignorant? i did my research before doing anything! <br/> <br/></p>
<p>brother: no it was not research you idiot! you listened to any salesman who was most able to persuade your unbacked mind. tell me the last time you made a thorough analysis of a company before investing in it? <br/> <br/></p>
<p>himanshu was confused now. <br/> <br/></p>
<p>brother continued: well yes why would you do the real research about a company when your goal is to earn only easy money! <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>himanshu was ashamed now. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>brother: listen himanshu, there are three things which you must know about stock market: <br/> <br/></p>
<p>1- in stock market the small investors don‚Äôt have any say. no matter how poorly a company is making its decisions a person with only 200 shares can‚Äôt go and advice the management to alter their decisions. a small investor has no power to take decision he only sits their and watches his investments going up and down in their values by the actions of others. it is the mere luck of the small investor if the company will make good or bad decisions. see how powerless an average stock holder is that he can‚Äôt even slightly alter the circumstances which decides the value of his investments. if one has slight dignity he shall not at all invest small amounts in stock market. the only people who enjoy control in stock market are the big investors. they are the only people who can force companies to make decisions which are beneficial for their investments. <br/> <br/></p>
<p>2- stock market is like democracy, often weak companies are voted by people as big players. as Keynes said, in stock market people don‚Äôt choose the companies which they think will perform better. but people choose the companies which they think other people will think that all other people think will be the winners. (complicated line, but stupid phenomenon) the point here I‚Äôm trying to make is that in stock market the stocks which perform better are the ones which the masses ‚Äòthink‚Äô should perform well, not the one which deserves. a loss making company can perform better than a company with stable balance sheet in stock market and this is mostly the case. <br/> <br/></p>
<p>3- big companies spend lot of money on advertisement to keep their share value increasing. as we have seen in the recent past, when the news went viral that Facebook is going to invest in jio, all the reliance media platforms worked to create excitement in average traders to invest in reliance, as a result the stock price of reliance has almost doubled. those media houses created such image of reliance and Facebook that after their tie up no power can stop reliance. the interesting thing is that they presented this propaganda as news, as facts and people fell for it. <br/> <br/></p>
<p>after listening to this himanshu went home, completed his pending office work, closed his demat account with loss, and promised himself not to fell for advertisements again. <br/> <br/></p>
