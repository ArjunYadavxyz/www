<h2>The Harm that Good Man Do</h2>

<p>Let me first make it clear that in this article we won’t be talking about what is morally good and bad. We will restrict ourselves in analysing how a good man can do equally bad in a society as a bad man can do. Let’s see which man is considered good from the society’s perspective. We have been told since childhood that a good man does not smoke, does not drink, goes regularly to temple, does not fight and so on. Overall it can be deduced that a person who is considered to be good from society’s perspective is a person who restricts his/her animal impulses. These are only some of the basic characteristics of a good man in a society. Most important characteristics is that the good man must agree with the popular and strong opinions of his time, failure to do so makes him a bad man. We preach Socrates now but he was considered a bad man in his time and was killed for having different opinions. His death was considered necessary in his time but later a great philosopher, i forgot his name, said “Humanity died the day Socrates was murdered.” Not only Socrates, Galileo was a bad man, Darwin was considered a bad man too in his times. And we can find lot of examples of the people who were considered bad in their times because they had different opinions than the prevailing ones. Later it turned out that the prevailing ones were wrong.</p>
<p>Moreover, good man are often used as weapons to commit inhuman acts. one of the famous example is that, nation loving good citizens of USA were used to support and justify the killings by USA government in middle east. Countries use propaganda to manipulate the good citizens of their land to die on foreign lands, in wars created by the politicians. But in any war politicians are the last ones who get killed, before them innocent nation loving troops and citizens gets killed. And we must know that without the support of good man no war is possible. Contrary to that bad man are hard to be manipulated. For a bad man his personal interest are far greater than country’s. For a good man, gap between personal interests and country’s interest are not that big as of a bad man. Good man WANT security, peace and development of their country. And their WANT is their weakness.</p>
<p>In this way, good man are the real bad man. They can be easily manipulated to do and support the bad things. But these bad things are not considered to be bad things as everyone agrees on them. As we already saw how the murder of many innocent people in middle east committed by the USA was considered a good act as people in USA collectively agreed that it was a good act. The first person in USA who publicly said the acts committed by USA in middle east are not good but inhuman must’ve also been considered a bad man by the gOoD man of USA.</p>
<p>It can only be seen in such a degraded society like ours that a person is considered good who does excessive consumerism, does wage slavery, forms his opinions by watching propaganda, goes regularly to church/temple/mosque but does not follow the religious texts (or in other words, he is Hindu/christian/Muslim on paper only but in real life he is the Satan of all religions) On the other hand a person, for example, the one who questions government’s war propaganda is labelled as anti-national. (Yes i do understand the necessity of fighting when enemy is standing at the door. But we must also ask “Are enemies really standing at door, or the enemy standing at door is a picture created by the few power hungry people who would be the last ones to get killed in the war?”)</p>
