<h2>News Is Bad</h2>

<p>I remember at some point in 2019 i was living as a news junkie. I was like one of those person who had 4 different news apps in phone and a dozen news websites bookmarked in browser. I, like other news junkies thought it is necessary to know whatever is happening in society. I enjoyed learning what funny thing did Trump said in interview earlier today and also the creative excuses Greta is making to bunk her classes.</p>
<p>All of this, keeping oneself updated of whats happening around the world is enjoyable to some extent, but tEcHNicaLlY speaking one is better off being a normal ‚ÄòI dont care what‚Äôs happening‚Äô person than your average News Junkie. But wait, claiming something without proving it is not the best thing to do. So I‚Äôll try to give you some reasons why being uP-TO-dATe or watching news can be bad.</p>
<p>First, most of the news is just filled with propaganda, one might say that ‚Äòpropaganda‚Äô is only associated with the news channels owned by the government like what they did in Soviet Russia and Nazi Germany. But that is not actually the case, we can see even in free markets different channels have different agenda associated with them. The only difference which i see in govt. owned news channel and free market news channel is that in govt. owned news channels, the reporters are forced to spread propaganda, Contrary to that in free market the free hand gives incentive to news channels to spread propaganda for their chosen politician whom the owners of the channel supports financially for their gain.</p>
<p>Secondly, News contains lot of bugs in it. As news is of dynamic in nature, news channels compete with each other to be the first to telecast a news. Obviously when anything happens, in the initial stages it provides only limited information. Because of this we can see that when people make opinions based on news they are mostly proved wrong in long run. for example, when Corona virus first came, news channels based on early/limited info told that it will wipe out humanity, but here after almost two years we can see that it was an over-exaggerated. Not only corona you can find many instances where the long run proves the news wrong. Because of this you can not completely relay on news for facts.</p>
<p>Third, as Hans Rosling said, news industry is dependent on our ‚Äòfear instinct‚Äô. Rosling argues that usually we humans tend to focus more on one bad thing in society than ten good things. For example, ten people saved by police is less likely to be showed on news than one person killed by them. Maybe this is not the best example but you get my point.</p>
<h2 id="so-whats-the-solution">So, what‚Äôs the solution?</h2>
<p>Read history. Yes you are not up to date when you read history books instead of watching news but you are more closer to truth than the average news junkie. When experts spend more time analyzing an event we get more accurate picture of it. For example, now we know more about Soviet Union than the people who lived at the time of Soviet Union did. Plus history is far less volatile than news. New findings time to time corrects the history of a particular events but still history is far-far more stable than news.</p>
<p>finally, we can say that news is like a rolling release Linux distribution, you get lot of bugs with it, things get fast changes, and you always live in fear than an update (news) might break your system.(brain)</p>
<p>History on the other hand is like stable long-term support Linux distribution. It is tested well before it is released. and you will always get small bug fixes every now and then. History like debian can be boring to some people but you know what, you can trust it.</p>
