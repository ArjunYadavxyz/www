<p>If you use Linux you would agree with me that its hard to resist the temptation of distrohopping. There‚Äôs so much to try. So many distributions sharing the same base with minor differences and still many of us (#metoo) find it difficult to be on the same distribution for more than two months. Now a days i don‚Äôt change my distro that regularly but being a former distrohopper i can say that on the one hand i wasted lot of time distrohopping on the other hand i learned lot of things about Linux by hopping from one distro to other.</p>

<p>So, few months ago at 2 am when people were sleeping i was distrohopping from Ubuntu to Debian and i was struggling to make Debian bootable on my device. I needed sleep, my eyes and brain were tired. I said screw it and went straight to bed. Crying at my situation i asked: Why i distrohop? Why? I came up with two possible reasons which i would share in this article.</p>
<h3 id="reason-1---the-distro-sucks">Reason 1 - The Distro Sucks</h3>
<p>Well what if the distribution is not made for your device? In my case it is Debian. I really WANT to use Debian as my daily driver but i have never been able to make it boot on my device. Although Debian based distos works completely fine on my device. That‚Äôs why i am left with no option but to distrohop from Debian. For you it might be some other distribution. But the point is if a distro sucks it must be changed. There‚Äôs no other option.</p>
<h3 id="reason-2---your-brain-sucks">Reason 2 - Your Brain Sucks</h3>
<p>Lets understand it by this example. If you are hungry and i give you 10 apples. Depending on your hunger you might eat any number of apples, lets say after eating 4 apples you have satisfied your hunger. Clearly as you are no more hungry you can‚Äôt eat anymore. Now what if i give you your favourite dish? unfortunately as much as you like that dish you won‚Äôt be able to eat much of it as you have already filled your stomach. Because your brain is connected with stomach it knows when to eat and when to stop. If our body looses this connectivity we will become pure slaves of our impulses and eat until we die. or maybe forget to eat, and die.</p>
<p>But do we have the same connection between our computers and our brain? Can we ever know that our computer has finally found its favourite distribution? the answer to the second question proposes another question: Do we actually care that we have found a good distribution? i mean‚Ä¶we can use our rationality to see if a distribution is working properly for our use case but this rationality often is overpowered by impulses of trying something new or ‚Äúoh this new distro has this unique feature‚Äù or ‚ÄúLuke says Artix users are superior than i must also use Artix‚Ä¶‚Äù</p>
<p>Unfortunately, when it comes to linux distribution our rationality fails in telling us that enough is enough‚Ä¶many like me often get overpowered by our impulses to parkour from one distro to other. When your brain sucks you end up distrohopping even from a perfectly working distro.</p>
