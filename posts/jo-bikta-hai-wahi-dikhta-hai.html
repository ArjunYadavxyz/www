<p>there is a famous proverb “jo dikhta hai wo bikta hai”. meaning that what gets marketed, gets sold.(giving it a business sense).wrong! for a moment let’s be a Marxist and turn the tables and say “jo bikta hai wahi dikhta hai” meaning: the thing which gets sold, is the one which exists.(everything else dies over time) <br/> <br/></p>
<p>by this i mean, survival of the fittest in the market. take for example the keypad phones of blackberry from 2009, which back than had a big market share. why isn’t the keypad phones from blackberry still dominating the market? if we listen to the first proverb, we would blame the poor marketing strategy from the blackerry’s part. however that’s not the case. people don’t use blackberry anymore not because blackberry didn’t spend much on marketing but because people had found new technology of touch screen smartphones. blackberry tried promoting their keypad phones and failed. in 2021 blackberry is nowhere to be seen.(it still exists but would to call it an existence?) <br/> <br/></p>
<p>the answer can be found in our new proverb. as Adam Smith says, increase in profit leads to increase in investment and increase in investment leads to increase in innovation. people in 2009 found the new touch screen phones, even though the ‘smartphones’ were barely in a workable state as they are now but people’s trust(purchase) in them lead to the flow of investment in smartphone industry and they continued to improve. on the other hand companies like blackberry and Nokia failed to mold themselves according to this new market. their sales continued to drop and by the time they realized that they are late it was already too late. today the reason teenage girls are able to make tiktok videos on their smart phones is because in 2009 people had put their money on these touch screen smartphones. people voted by their money for the thriving existence of smart phones and for the murder of blackberry.(and murder of the other keypad phones) <br/> <br/></p>
<p>capital is the life line of any product. investors provide capital. profit is the only criteria which incentivize or dis-incentivize the investors for investing. and profit depends on whether the product is getting sold or not sales depends on whether the product is relivent for the market or not. reduction in relivancy leads to reduction in sales, reduction in sales leads to reduction in profit, which leads to reduction in capital, reduction in capital leads to winding up of the company. <br/> <br/></p>
<p>market is no different from the natural world. only the fittest survives. the only product which exists is the one which is strong enough to satisfy the wants of the market. i.e the one which gets sold, is the one which exists. <br/> <br/></p>
