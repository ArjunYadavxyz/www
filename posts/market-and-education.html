<p>
the magical wizard of capitalism commodifies everything it touches. unfortunately even education wasn’t able to protect itself from the spell of that wizard. consequences of commodification of education are depressing. however the degradation of education seems to be a necessary condition to satisfy the hunger of market.
</p>
<br/> <br/>
<h2>
market oriented approach of education institutions
</h2>
<br/>
<p>
to compete with other universities and in order to show higher job placement percentage universities restrict their course list to what is demanded by the market. seeking truth is no more the goal of education. a study which only seeks truth has nothing worthy in it if it doesn’t satisfy the demand of market, the demand of employers! <br/> <br/> tell me how many private colleges in India are offering graduation in Urdu, Hindi, philosophy etc.? <br/> <br/> the number of students who take for example Urdu as their subject in their school and colleges is dwindling very fast. on this rashid says:
</p>
<br/> <br/>
<p style="text-align:center">
<i>Maangey Allah se bas itni dua hai Rashid <br/> Main jo Urdu mein vaseeyat likhoon beta parh ley</i> <br/> <br/> All rashid asks for Allah is just one small gift: <br/> If I write my will in Urdu, may my son be able to read it.
</p>
<br/> <br/>
<p>
nevertheless, Urdu continues to be extensively quoted in debates, and it remains to be the most quotable of all Indian languages. khurshid Afsar Bisrani puts it aptly:
</p>
<br/> <br/>
<p style="text-align:center">
<i>Ab Urdu Kya hai ek koothey ki tawaif hai <br/> mazaa har ek leta hai mohabbat kaun karta hai</i> <br/> <br/> what is Urdu now but a whore in whorehouse <br/> whoever wants has fun with her, very few love her
</p>
<br/> <br/>
<p>
at the ends it turns out that both universities and students have submitted themselves to the market. market decides what universities should offer and what students should learn. people blame communism for forcing their decisions on people, just see what the market is doing!
</p>
<br/> <br/>
<h2>
effect on man
</h2>
<br/>
<p>
now man is no more a tool making animal but a tool itself. and because of its easily molding characteristics this tool comes in multiple varieties like software engineer, mechanical engineer, business administrator etc. <br/> <br/> now man no more studies what he likes but only what is liked by the market.
