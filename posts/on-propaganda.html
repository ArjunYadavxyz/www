1- we here by propaganda mean the spreading of highly modified facts (or complete lies) on mass media by the governments or any institution in order to achieve their ends.
</p>
<p>
2- with the help of mass media the distance (alienation) between of political leaders and the citizens has reduced. Resulting into mass support of political ideologies. The Putin government in Russia ever since Putin came to power has been target to hard questions from the west, calling Putin a totalitarian/ dictator. But the western cry doesn’t matter much as the majority of people in Russia are in favour of Putin government. Intellectuals believe that this support of Putin government in the heart of Russians was achieved by the help of propaganda. Well Putin should be indebted to communists as when the soviet regime collapsed almost every house in Russia had a TV which communists distributed in order to spread propaganda but unfortunately he was Putin for whom the TV was used to make his image as the saviour of Russian people from uncertainty and corruption.
</p>
<p>
3- mass media has reached almost all of the world, an average man living in city is constantly surrounded by mass media whether it be a smart phone, laptop, news papers, TV or in some cases even books are used to spread propaganda.(for example the numerous books written by politicians or part time politicians) for sure mass media has reduced the problem of distance (alienation) on one hand and invented the problem of propaganda. We can find numerous news channels spreading biased news. Documentaries being funded by politicians to defame others or glorify themselves it is really hard for man to differentiate between real vs fake, facts vs exaggerated facts.
</p>
<p>
4- people in general have weak opinions that’s why an average man can’t question propaganda made by experts which is shown them as fact and shown again and again until they fell into it. Real problem starts when people start to construct their opinions based on the propaganda they consume on mass media.
</p>
<p>
5- so if having weak opinions is bad then why don’t just have strong opinions? Well it turns out that having strong opinions can’t help you much either. Forming strong opinions is itself a lengthy process, it requires hard work, read read and read! And even after years of hard work you have formed some strong opinion for example about religion it will help you only to the point of figuring out religious propaganda but what about political propaganda? Scientific propaganda? Historical propaganda? Etc. no one can have strong opinions about everything in existence. You can save yourself from propaganda in few areas but you will always be an easy target for propaganda in many areas.
</p>
<p>
<p>6- I in past used to thing that if someone watch propaganda for and against simultaneously his mind will automatically cut the extreme shown in both cases and will come to centre of the opinion and will be able to see facts more clearly but boy I was wrong! In reality it is really hard to come at center and see the facts more clearly by consuming propaganda alone. Propaganda always makes you “for or against”. Coming at centre and seeing the facts requires strong opinions which can’t be formed by consuming propaganda. By consuming propaganda mind will become like a grasshopper who will jump from one opinion to other, grasshopper is lucky as he decides when to jump or not but the jumps of propaganda consumer’s (our) mind is decided by mass media</p>
