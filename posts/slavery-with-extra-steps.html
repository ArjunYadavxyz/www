Well, you don‚Äôt have to be a maxist to understand the depressing conditions of working population as a whole today.
</p>
<p>
In 18th century master went in search for slaves, in 21st century slaves go out in search for master. in 18th century master needed salves, in 21st century slaves need master. lot of things have changed in last two centuries but those changes are only on surface, the underlying principles are still enact. the freedom enjoyed by employees over slaves is to a certain degree a mirage or just an illusion of freedom ( https://understandingdeeppolitics.org/the-illusion-of-freedom/ ) the biggest difference between an ordinary slave of 18th century and an employee of 21st century is that the slave knew that he is a slave by force, contrary to it employee thinks he is working for his boss by his own free will.

<h2>
cost of slavery
</h2>
<p>
Slaves are expensive machines to get the production done. slaves are not your ordinary free raw materials gifted by mother nature to its beloved capitalists. master must spend money to keep its slaves alive. unlike machines slaves can‚Äôt work 24 hours a day. they must sleep and rest (somewhere) and it becomes a necessity for the master to spend on slave‚Äôs housing. slaves also need food and clothing means more work and spending from the part of master. and if the slave is from 2021, then he also NEEDS alcohol, youtube, netfilx, social media, smartphone etc. for survival. in order to keep his slaves alive poor master not only have to spend money on their needs but also have to decide which commodities to buy for his slaves. poor master will spend his weekends watching smartphone reviews on youtube to select best value smartphone for his slaves. its unprofitable to loose slaves at young age that‚Äôs why master must also spend money on slave‚Äôs healthcare.
</p>
<p>
In traditional slavery, all slaves know that they are slaves, they know they don‚Äôt have any freedom. moreover the master, even after spending money on the survival of slaves has to bear all the resistance and criticism from the slaves.
</p>
<p>
As the wealth of a society advances and number of available commodities increase, a moment comes where yesterday‚Äôs luxuries become today‚Äôs necessities, maintaining slaves becomes increasingly expensive. which gives disincentive to continue breeding slaves and a need arises to upgrade traditional slavery. a moment must come where capitalist of the world must unite to form new slave society where slaves must be given some real and predominantly illusion of freedom in order to eliminate the cost and troubles involved in traditional slavery.
</p>
<br/>
<h2>
Slavery Delta Variant
</h2>
<p>
Learnt from the mistakes done by masters in traditional slavery. masters get incentive to give little bit freedom to their slaves, for example-
</p>
<br/>
<p>
<b>1- Housing:</b> slaves now can decide freely where they want to live (yes, kinda freedom, but employees can‚Äôt live much further from their offices otherwise they will be spending their precious free time on daily commute and extra money will be spent on petrol/gas so they must end up selecting a near by place to their office)
</p>
<p>
<b>2- Purchases from free market (like cloths, electronics etc.)</b> Free will is rare in free market, decisions of employees are mostly influenced by the advertising.
</p>
<p>
Advertising is the biggest producer, it produces the needs of useless things in the mind of employees. as a result of aggressive advertising employees end up doing the jobs they don‚Äôt like to buy the products they don‚Äôt need.
</p>
<br/>
<p>
Who follows Hinduism or Buddhism when the new normal is to follow Consumerism?
</p>
<p>
At least in traditional slavery the slaves were not affected by this consumerism disease. but consumerism act as a fuel in this new economic machine of slavery delta variant. consumerism is the driving force of modern slavery.
</p>
<p>
I‚Äôve already written about freedom, I‚Äôll protect myself from repeating the same thing here, If you are interested you can read it <a href=https://arjunyadav.xyz/stories/lukesmithfreedom.html>here.</a>

<h2>
Traditional Slavery vs Slavery Delta Variant (fReE employees)
</h2>
<p>
Freedom is given to some extent to employees, but this freedom as we have already seen is just a mere mirage. even more this freedom is dangerous in the sense that it give the illusion if freedom to employees. they think they are free but in reality their decisions are influenced by other factors. our jobs have much more effect on us then we think, it decides what type of friends we would have, it predominate our thoughts when we are stuck in traffic jam, our jobs decide on what days and time we will spend with our families and so on.
</p>
<p>
When one is suffering from a disease the worst thing he can do is to live in a illusion that he is health. only when one recognizes that he is suffering he can struggle to find a cure. that‚Äôs why i said previously that at least slaves knew that they have no freedom. that recognition, and only that led to their emancipation. but today‚Äôs employees are enjoying their illusion of freedom while in reality they continue to suffer slavery!
