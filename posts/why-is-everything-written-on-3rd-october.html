<article>
<p>You can see that everything written before this post shows that it was posted on 3rd October 2021. That is partially true. Yes every post is (re)posted on 3rd October 2021, but they were actually written in a time span of last 3 months. Previously my website was showing correct published dates but yesterday i had to go through some big changes in the way i manage this website. I had to change my way because previously i was managing my website like a cave man. Literally doing everything manually. I would write every post in plain html, write each post’s header and footer manually, and finally i updated my website entry of each post manually. I did everything manually just because i didn’t wanted to use Wordpress and I wasn’t either satisfied with Hugo and other static site builders because of their over complicated usage and their approach of doing too much magic. I just needed something to manage my blog. nothing more than that and finally after two sleepless nights i came across a simple 130 line bash script which did exactly what i wanted it to do i.e Just convert markdown into html and update the entry on website. Nothing more nothing less.</p>
<p>Finally, This new and better way of managing my website has resulted in one minor inconvenience of showing all my previously written articles to be published on 3rd October 2021.</p>
