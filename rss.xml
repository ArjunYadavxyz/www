<title>Future Zucks Bro!</title>
<guid>https://arjunyadav.xyz/posts/future-zucks-bro!.html</guid>
<pubDate>Sat, 20 Nov 2021 22:40:41 +0530</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<p>Everyone on internet has been talking about Meta and Metaverse since its idea was proposed by Zuckerberg. I think the general opinion of people on internet can be summerised this way: “The idea of metaverse looks like something from black mirror. Everyone knows its bad hence its just another bad decision made by Facebook.”</p>
<p>I do agree with the first part that the idea of Meta does look like something from black mirror and is depressing. however, as far as second part is concerned, i think, Facebook actually made a right decision. At this point metaverse IS inevitable And most of the people who are criticizing Facebook WILL be in metaverse.</p>
<h3 id="why-metaverse-is-inevitable">Why Metaverse is Inevitable</h3>
<p>I remember reading an essay where the author claimed that when a species becomes more advanced it tends to focus its attention on finding shortcuts. What kind of shortcuts? We humans have reached a stage where we focus much of our attention on achieving things virtually rather than in real life. Why virtually? Because its easier. I quote : “Technology is fairly good at controlling external external reality to promote real biological fitness, but its even better at delivering fake fitness - subjective cues of survival and reproduction without real-world effects” further he says “…I think that aliens forget to send radio signals or colonise space because they’re too busy with runaway consumerism and virtual reality narcissism. Once they turn inwards to chase their shiny pennies of pleasure, they loose the cosmic plot”</p>
<p>This is the reason why i think metaverse is inevitable. Metaverse is the next step of the ‘shortcuts’ we create to make our lives easier. Want to go to Switzerland but you are an average wage earner from a third world country? No problem! just buy this affordable meta VR set, download/stream this Switzerland program and within minutes you are in Switzerland. (virtually) Isn’t it a good shortcut? Traditionally, you would have to earn a lot of money to travel in Switzerland but now (lets say 2027) you can get it cheaply without leaving your parent’s basement!</p>
<p>Now for us internet is not new. We know enough history of internet that we can see patterns to predict future. I agree with Zuck when he said “Our (consumer’s) internet consumption has moved from ‘text’ in its early stages to pictures to now videos (Tiktok, Insta-stories…) and future’s consumer demands a metaverse” Metaverse is inevitable if Facebook doesn’t do it someone else will. Internet is fast and it is getting faster day by day, companies like facebook are investing lots of money into making equipment for metaverse, people want to engage more with VR. In other words consumers are willing to buy metaverse, companies are willing to sell metaverse and infrastructure is willing to support metaverse. Hence it is inevitable.</p>
<h3 id="going-back-to-2004">Going Back to 2004</h3>
<p>What would have happened if Zuckerberg in 2004 had made a similar announcement for Facebook what he made for meta?</p>
<p>Zuckerberg: “umm..Yeah so..we got internet but we’re still kinda unconnected so I’m gonna launch Facebook a social media website by which people would be able to connect with each other, share their birthday pictures with friends, can send messages, if you are a seller you can sell products. Basically the possibilities are limitless”</p>
<p>People: “OMG! its so frightening! we would be able to send each other messages but you know what this dude will own the platform so his company would be able to read those messages. And no I’m never gonna share my private birthday memories with people on internet. What do you mean by sellers can sell their products on internet? they would be able to target advertising and sell me the things that i don’t want to buy! No this idea is clearly stupid no one is ever gonna use your authoritative platform. No one will!”</p>
<p>But what actually happened? in 2021 there are approx 2.8 billion Facebook users. If Facebook is bad than no one should use it right?</p>
<h3 id="democrazy">Democrazy</h3>
<p>Its a well known fact that Facebook (company) is a privacy nightmare but still its users are constantly increasing. Generally it seems like convenience overpowers common sense. Few idiots who get pissed off by the privacy policies of these social media platforms make their own websites to share their based articles. (Bascially these pople focus their attention on finding alternatives) VERY few saints leave internet altogether. However, free market is like democracy which is ruled by majority not by minority. Majority on internet needs convenience, hence ignorant convenience rules the internet. Metaverse seems to be a really convenient thing. Despite the consequences of metaverse i think, people will still vote (use) for its rule. Sure a minority of outlaws will always exist with their self hosted alternatives but they will never be able to become a member of Internet’s parliament.</p>
<h3 id="dont-be-a-luke-smith">Don’t be a Luke Smith</h3>
<p>Luke Smith is the reason why i have my personal website. And I’m not alone, there are many people who are influenced by Luke. But one critique of Luke is that he seems to be in an irrelevant war against social media. He is focusing too much on finding alternatives. Do you really need a self hosted [twitter alternative] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOiCACmjKBM)? Twitter is a disease. When you are suffering from a disease, you don’t find it’s alternatives you get rid of it altogether.</p>
<p>What Luke says: “Host Mestadon and free yourself from corporate owned twitter” What i hear: “host your own cancer to free yourself from corporate owned cancer”</p>
<p>What i’m trying to say is when metaverse will become a normal thing maybe lets say in 2028, it would be better to not to host your own metaverse or find alternatives but to rather leave metaverse altogether.</p>
<p>Luke Smith in 2028:</p>
<p><a href=../pix/luke2028.jpg><img class=resmid src="../pix/luke2028.jpg" alt="luke"></a></p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>I think Zuck made a right decision by focusing his companies focus on metverse. The reason he was able to make such an prediction for future is that now we know a thing or two about the history of internet and connecting dots leads nowhere but to metaverse. It seems metaverse industry is inevitable. And Zuck’s willingness to be an early bird in this industry might beneficial for Facebook (Meta) that’s why i think future Zuck’s bro!</p>]]></description>

<title>The Reason People DistroHop</title>
<guid>https://arjunyadav.xyz/posts/the-reason-people-distrohop.html</guid>
<pubDate>Sun, 14 Nov 2021 14:44:35 +0530</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<p>If you use Linux you would agree with me that its hard to resist the temptation of distrohopping. There’s so much to try. So many distributions sharing the same base with minor differences and still many of us (#metoo) find it difficult to be on the same distribution for more than two months. Now a days i don’t change my distro that regularly but being a former distrohopper i can say that on the one hand i wasted lot of time distrohopping on the other hand i learned lot of things about Linux by hopping from one distro to other.</p>
<p><a href=../pix/hophophop.gif><img class=resmid src="../pix/hophophop.gif" alt="hophophop"></a></p>
<p>So, few months ago at 2 am when people were sleeping i was distrohopping from Ubuntu to Debian and i was struggling to make Debian bootable on my device. I needed sleep, my eyes and brain were tired. I said screw it and went straight to bed. Crying at my situation i asked: Why i distrohop? Why? I came up with two possible reasons which i would share in this article.</p>
<h3 id="reason-1---the-distro-sucks">Reason 1 - The Distro Sucks</h3>
<p>Well what if the distribution is not made for your device? In my case it is Debian. I really WANT to use Debian as my daily driver but i have never been able to make it boot on my device. Although Debian based distos works completely fine on my device. That’s why i am left with no option but to distrohop from Debian. For you it might be some other distribution. But the point is if a distro sucks it must be changed. There’s no other option.</p>
<h3 id="reason-2---your-brain-sucks">Reason 2 - Your Brain Sucks</h3>
<p>Lets understand it by this example. If you are hungry and i give you 10 apples. Depending on your hunger you might eat any number of apples, lets say after eating 4 apples you have satisfied your hunger. Clearly as you are no more hungry you can’t eat anymore. Now what if i give you your favourite dish? unfortunately as much as you like that dish you won’t be able to eat much of it as you have already filled your stomach. Because your brain is connected with stomach it knows when to eat and when to stop. If our body looses this connectivity we will become pure slaves of our impulses and eat until we die. or maybe forget to eat, and die.</p>
<p>But do we have the same connection between our computers and our brain? Can we ever know that our computer has finally found its favourite distribution? the answer to the second question proposes another question: Do we actually care that we have found a good distribution? i mean…we can use our rationality to see if a distribution is working properly for our use case but this rationality often is overpowered by impulses of trying something new or “oh this new distro has this unique feature” or “Luke says Artix users are superior than i must also use Artix…”</p>
<p>Unfortunately, when it comes to linux distribution our rationality fails in telling us that enough is enough…many like me often get overpowered by our impulses to parkour from one distro to other. When your brain sucks you end up distrohopping even from a perfectly working distro.</p>]]></description>

<title>News Is Bad</title>
<guid>https://arjunyadav.xyz/posts/news-is-bad.html</guid>
<pubDate>Tue, 09 Nov 2021 20:30:11 +0530</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<p>I remember at some point in 2019 i was living as a news junkie. I was like one of those person who had 4 different news apps in phone and a dozen news websites bookmarked in browser. I, like other news junkies thought it is necessary to know whatever is happening in society. I enjoyed learning what funny thing did Trump said in interview earlier today and also the creative excuses Greta is making to bunk her classes.</p>
<p>All of this, keeping oneself updated of whats happening around the world is enjoyable to some extent, but tEcHNicaLlY speaking one is better off being a normal ‘I dont care what’s happening’ person than your average News Junkie. But wait, claiming something without proving it is not the best thing to do. So I’ll try to give you some reasons why being uP-TO-dATe or watching news can be bad.</p>
<p>First, most of the news is just filled with propaganda, one might say that ‘propaganda’ is only associated with the news channels owned by the government like what they did in Soviet Russia and Nazi Germany. But that is not actually the case, we can see even in free markets different channels have different agenda associated with them. The only difference which i see in govt. owned news channel and free market news channel is that in govt. owned news channels, the reporters are forced to spread propaganda, Contrary to that in free market the free hand gives incentive to news channels to spread propaganda for their chosen politician whom the owners of the channel supports financially for their gain.</p>
<p>Secondly, News contains lot of bugs in it. As news is of dynamic in nature, news channels compete with each other to be the first to telecast a news. Obviously when anything happens, in the initial stages it provides only limited information. Because of this we can see that when people make opinions based on news they are mostly proved wrong in long run. for example, when Corona virus first came, news channels based on early/limited info told that it will wipe out humanity, but here after almost two years we can see that it was an over-exaggerated. Not only corona you can find many instances where the long run proves the news wrong. Because of this you can not completely relay on news for facts.</p>
<p>Third, as Hans Rosling said, news industry is dependent on our ‘fear instinct’. Rosling argues that usually we humans tend to focus more on one bad thing in society than ten good things. For example, ten people saved by police is less likely to be showed on news than one person killed by them. Maybe this is not the best example but you get my point.</p>
<h2 id="so-whats-the-solution">So, what’s the solution?</h2>
<p>Read history. Yes you are not up to date when you read history books instead of watching news but you are more closer to truth than the average news junkie. When experts spend more time analyzing an event we get more accurate picture of it. For example, now we know more about Soviet Union than the people who lived at the time of Soviet Union did. Plus history is far less volatile than news. New findings time to time corrects the history of a particular events but still history is far-far more stable than news.</p>
<p>finally, we can say that news is like a rolling release Linux distribution, you get lot of bugs with it, things get fast changes, and you always live in fear than an update (news) might break your system.(brain)</p>
<p>History on the other hand is like stable long-term support Linux distribution. It is tested well before it is released. and you will always get small bug fixes every now and then. History like debian can be boring to some people but you know what, you can trust it.</p>]]></description>

<title>Melophile Society And Its Future</title>
<guid>https://arjunyadav.xyz/posts/melophile-society-and-its-future.html</guid>
<pubDate>Wed, 27 Oct 2021 18:57:56 +0530</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<p>The Musical Revolution and its consequences have been a disaster for human race. Gone are the days of sophisticated lyrics and good voice. Junk lyrics with auto-tune voice is ruling the music market. This is the music revolution. You might find me ranting about these new age songs here but this is also true that there are way more people who intoxicate themselves with these type of junk songs as compared to the people who enjoy good old songs.</p>
<p>Generally we listen to music for its ability to give pleasure to our mind. As consuming music activates same part of brain similar to what is activated by eating food and taking <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/music-produces-pleasure-similarly-drugs-and-sex-553946">drugs</a>. Not only for pleasure we might also consume music to escape from reality or just for nostalgia. Listing to music for escape from reality is enough to make one restrain from indulging too much into music. Apart from that the quality of music we consume is also degrading. Lets see in coming paragraph how.</p>
<p><a href=../pix/doomermusic.jpg><img class=resmid src="../pix/doomermusic.jpg" alt="doomer"></a></p>
<h2 id="empty-calories-it-sounds-good-but-the-lyrics-are-meaningless">Empty Calories (It sounds good but the lyrics are meaningless)</h2>
<p>Remember the song from your grandfather’s time “Rote hue aate hain sab hasta hua jo jayega wo…” or from your father’s time “duniya mane bura to goli maro, dar ke jeena bhi koi jeena yaaro?” and what do you have the young of 2021? “Diladu Ghar chandigarh mai…” and “coca cola tu, sona sona tu, coca cola tu, sona sona tu….” (For the ones from English speaking countries, remember the lyrics of The Gambler Song? and compare it with 6ix9ine’s “Niggas act dumb when i act dumb-dumb tell ’em don’t act dumb coz I’m dumber”) Don’t you think over the years the quality of lyrics have reduced down to just being junk? Its quite normal these days, for a junk song to hit the trending list. But it was difficult, two decades ago for a junk song to achieve the same. The question is what is the difference now that junk songs are getting all the popularity? I think the reason lies in the MUSIC used in the songs. The music which is being used now a days in songs is much more stimulating than what it was 2 or 3 decades ago. Now with the help of technology artificial stimulative sounds can be created which are nonexistent in old songs which used real instruments to produce sounds. As a result of all this the songs now a days have become much more stimulating, because the focus is more on the music rather than lyrics the quality of lyrics has come down. And why not? People are listening songs for pleasure or escape and for these reasons they need more stimulating things which are being provided by the artificial music. This is similar to eating junk food.</p>
<p>Like the junk food which tastes good but does not have anything healthy in it. The same way it is with modern music. The taste of Junk Food hides its emptiness. The taste alone hides its poor nutrition value. When eating Fast Food people forget about the nutrition value and only focus on its taste. If you ask an American to choose between a McDonald’s Burger and a Banana, he would probably choose the Burger even though it will have bad impact on his health. As a rule of thumb you can make people eat shit if you add enough spices in it. People will be happy to eat shit as long as it will taste good. And if for some reason you tell them that what they are eating is just a shit camouflaged by spices and cheese, people will boycott you.</p>
<p>In the similar way it is with modern music. On the surface the new songs are much more stimulating and sounds good but deep down they are just a shit camouflaged by artificial stimulative music.</p>
<h2 id="lenin-on-music">Lenin on Music</h2>
<p>Yes..yes..he killed 20 Gazillion people in Soviet Russia, so what? For a moment lets forget his political sins and see what he has to say on music. Maybe we will learn something from it.</p>
<p>“But often I can’t listen to music. It acts on my nerves. It makes one want to say a lot of sweet nonsense and stroke the heads of people who live in a filthy hell-hole and yet can create such beauty. But you can’t stroke anyone’s head today – you’ll get your hands cut off. The need is to beat them over the head, beat them mercilessly even though we, as an ideal, are against any coercion of people. Hm, hm … it’s a hellishly difficult necessity.”</p>

<title>Review of Various Linux Distros</title>
<guid>https://arjunyadav.xyz/posts/review-of-various-linux-distros.html</guid>
<pubDate>Sun, 24 Oct 2021 13:34:22 +0530</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<p>If we go to Distrowatch we can find that there are hundreds of Linux distros listed there but at the end we can see that most of those Linux distros are more or less themed versions of three major Linux distributions i.e Arch, Debian and Fedora. Reviewing all of the distributions available on Distrowatch is not only time consuming but also irrelevant. Hence i will restrict myself with reviewing only the ones which i think are relevant.</p>
<h2 id="arch">Arch</h2>
<p>Arch is a rolling-release Distro which means whenever a new version of a package is released Arch users get it through instant updates. In Arch Linux, there are lot of updates, updates everywhere! Arch users are the first ones to get latest software in Linux world, but they are also the first ones to encounter the bugs. One thing which comes to the mind of many users when they start to use Arch is that they should’ve listened to the memes.</p>
<p>Although in official repository, Arch has less packages availability than that of Debian. However to compensate that arch has its ‘Arch User Repository’ (AUR) where the arch users submit the software compiled by them. Personally I’ve found that every proprietary software which is made to work on Linux is available in AUR. This is a big selling point of Arch Linux, you don’t have to go on different websites to download .deb and .rpm in order to install software on your machine. On Arch, for example if you want to install brave browser you just need to type <code>yay -S brave-bin</code> and that’s it Brave will be installed on your system. Contrary to that if you were using a Debian based distribution you would have to go through 3-4 step process to install brave!</p>
<h2 id="debian">Debian</h2>
<p>Debian has three release models i.e Stable, Testing and Unstable. However according to Debian’s website only stable is recommended for general use. Debian developers use Testing and Unstable as the testing ground for Stable. But still you can find many Debian Unstable users on internet who claim that their distro does not break. Debian has the highest number of packages in its repositories, more than double than that of Arch’s but you won’t be able to find those proprietary software in Debian’s repository which are available in AUR. When used on workstations Debian Stable is criticised for having obsolete packages. It is understandable for Debian after one year of its release to have older packages but even the new release lags behind 5 months of development. It has its own use case, on server you don’t usually want your disto to be a rolling-release, on servers debian comes to your help. But still there are lot of people who don’t care what version number they are using. These people use Debian stable as their daily driver and are happy with it. I consider myself of this category however my love with Debian is only one sided, Debian refuses to boot on my hardware even though i used iso with non-free drivers.</p>
<h2 id="fedora">Fedora</h2>
<p>I’m not sure about the release cycle of Fedora. It’s not a complete rolling-release nor its a stable release. Some parts of Fedora gets all kind of updates on the other hand some just get security fixes. Although a new version of fedora comes every six months.</p>
<p>I’ve two major concerns about Fedora. First, it is usually the fist distro to adopt a new technology. Fedora was the first distro to use wayland. Now wayland has made the Linux experience much more smoother however when it first came, in its early stage, wayland was giving much problems. Too much ram usage, applications not supporting wayland were some of the many problems which were associated with wayland in its early stage and as Fedora was using wayland, all its users were suffering because of it. Wayland is only one example of many new technologies which were adopted by Fedora before anyone else did. As desktop users we must know that Fedora is a testing ground for red hat. Hence it is not the best thing to be used on personal computers.</p>
<p>Second, the package manager used by Fedora: DNF, it is slooooow! DNF automatically updates its repository everytime user wants to install a package. This sounds good on paper however the update of repository takes longer on fedora as compared to that of Debian. Which makes it troublesome to install or perform basic tasks with packages in Fedora terminal.</p>
<h2 id="ubuntu">Ubuntu</h2>
<p>Ubuntu is the windows of Linux world. It is the most hated one. But still i think in consumer market Ubuntu has played the biggest role in the success of Linux. Linux would have only being using by nerds in their parent’s basements if it was not for Ubuntu. On the surface you can say Ubuntu is based on Debian, but can you really recommend a new user to use Debian? That is the work done by Ubuntu devs to make ‘Linux for humans’.</p>
<p>Yes there are some genuine concerns about ubuntu for example snaps etc. but hey, no one is forcing you to stick with ubuntu, now its no more 2010. Other distros have matured in providing a good consumer experience, just move to them if you don’t like snaps and the direction in which ubuntu is moving.</p>]]></description>

<title>The Harm that Good Man Do</title>
<guid>https://arjunyadav.xyz/posts/the-harm-that-good-man-do.html</guid>
<pubDate>Sun, 10 Oct 2021 22:27:22 +0530</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<p>Let me first make it clear that in this article we won’t be talking about what is morally good and bad. We will restrict ourselves in analysing how a good man can do equally bad in a society as a bad man can do. Let’s see which man is considered good from the society’s perspective. We have been told since childhood that a good man does not smoke, does not drink, goes regularly to temple, does not fight and so on. Overall it can be deduced that a person who is considered to be good from society’s perspective is a person who restricts his/her animal impulses. These are only some of the basic characteristics of a good man in a society. Most important characteristics is that the good man must agree with the popular and strong opinions of his time, failure to do so makes him a bad man. We preach Socrates now but he was considered a bad man in his time and was killed for having different opinions. His death was considered necessary in his time but later a great philosopher, i forgot his name, said “Humanity died the day Socrates was murdered.” Not only Socrates, Galileo was a bad man, Darwin was considered a bad man too in his times. And we can find lot of examples of the people who were considered bad in their times because they had different opinions than the prevailing ones. Later it turned out that the prevailing ones were wrong.</p>
<p>Moreover, good man are often used as weapons to commit inhuman acts. one of the famous example is that, nation loving good citizens of USA were used to support and justify the killings by USA government in middle east. Countries use propaganda to manipulate the good citizens of their land to die on foreign lands, in wars created by the politicians. But in any war politicians are the last ones who get killed, before them innocent nation loving troops and citizens gets killed. And we must know that without the support of good man no war is possible. Contrary to that bad man are hard to be manipulated. For a bad man his personal interest are far greater than country’s. For a good man, gap between personal interests and country’s interest are not that big as of a bad man. Good man WANT security, peace and development of their country. And their WANT is their weakness.</p>
<p>In this way, good man are the real bad man. They can be easily manipulated to do and support the bad things. But these bad things are not considered to be bad things as everyone agrees on them. As we already saw how the murder of many innocent people in middle east committed by the USA was considered a good act as people in USA collectively agreed that it was a good act. The first person in USA who publicly said the acts committed by USA in middle east are not good but inhuman must’ve also been considered a bad man by the gOoD man of USA.</p>
<p>It can only be seen in such a degraded society like ours that a person is considered good who does excessive consumerism, does wage slavery, forms his opinions by watching propaganda, goes regularly to church/temple/mosque but does not follow the religious texts (or in other words, he is Hindu/christian/Muslim on paper only but in real life he is the Satan of all religions) On the other hand a person, for example, the one who questions government’s war propaganda is labelled as anti-national. (Yes i do understand the necessity of fighting when enemy is standing at the door. But we must also ask “Are enemies really standing at door, or the enemy standing at door is a picture created by the few power hungry people who would be the last ones to get killed in the war?”)</p>

<title>Living in the simulation paradise</title>
<guid>https://arjunyadav.xyz/posts/living-in-the-simulation-paradise.html</guid>
<pubDate>Fri, 08 Oct 2021 19:01:36 +0530</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<html lang="en">
<body>
<p>
What if we are living in a simulation. What if we all are just some characters in a video game, In which all the decisions which we think that we make (Deciding to drink water or choosing partner) are actually not made by us but by the person who is playing the video game. or maybe the simulation code from which our universe is made makes all the decisions. What if all the laws of nature are just the laws of a simulation code.
</p>
<p>
This is my favourite conspiracy theory. Even <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBKRuI2zHp0"  target="_blank" rel="noopener">Elon Musk</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmcrG7ZZKUc" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Neil deGrasse Tyson</a> believe that we might be living in a computer program. and you might also have some belief in this too. but unfortunately for us being just some video game characters it is impossible for us to know that if we are living in a simulated reality or not. This world is our reality, This code is our world. With our senses we can only experience this code.
</p>
<p>
The person who created this world, for the sake of this argument, lets call him God. And the problem with god is that we have not seen him. And god is the only being who knows whether our world simulated or not. When we have never met god how can we ask him this question?
</p>
<p>
The only solution left to us is matrix. We must enquire that can we make a simulated reality in which a person’s body can still be in Delhi but his mind will be transferred to some other reality? If that can be done, we can conclude that if we can create a simulated reality then why can’t god too. and this will increase the chances of us living in a simulated reality from zero. One good thing here is that we have already reached a time where different realities are already being created. While consuming these simulated realities man only exists physically in this world but his mind is in different reality.
</p>
<h3>
Before we go further let us just understand what we mean by reality here:
</h3>
<p>
To experience our world we use our senses. what we See, Touch, Smell, Taste constitutes our reality. For example, Bulls can’t see the colour red, hence in their reality red doesn’t exist. Only the colours a Bull can see are real for him. At this moment lets divide reality into two parts first, Real Real (real truth) and second Perceived Real (what we think is real)
</p>
<p>
The first real, Real Real (real truth) doesn’t care if we know about it or not. It exist outside us and is independent form us. from example Black Holes in space still existed in space even when we didn’t know anything about them and they still continue to exist even after humans got to know that they exist.
</p>
<p>
The second real, Perceived Real, is inside us and totally dependent on our senses. For us red colour exist is our Perceived Real but for Bull red colour doesn’t exist as he can’t see it that’s why the colour Red doesn’t constitute his Perceived Real. Perceived Real is much more stronger for us than Real Real (real truth) as it is only through our Perceived Real that we make our decisions. What if god exist and he is standing right next to you but like Bull who is colour blind, you are god blind and can’t see god. If it weren’t for our god blindness, this thousands of years old debate on existence of god wouldn’t have existed. (Sadiyon se yeh behas chalti rahi, par bhagwaan ki baat jahan thi wahi atki rahi!)
</p>
<p>
If our senses can be fooled, our perceived truth can be fooled. By fooling our senses a simulated world can be created where a person will loose all its touch form Real Real (the real truth) and enter into an illusionary simulation. And for a person who’s living in illusionary simulation, real truth doesn’t matter anymore. for him illusionary simulation is new real. lets see how with current technology we are creating bits of illusionary perceived real. step by step we will see how every single one of senses can be fooled. and finally we will see how a time will come when we will completely loose our touch with current reality and will enter in a simulated one.
</p>
<h3>
Fooling our senses with technology:
</h3>
<p>
<b>Eyes:</b> TV screens are good examples of creating small simulations/matrix. Pictures shown on TV screens are like phantoms i.e half present half absent. What i mean by that is the characters in movies and TV serials are fictional however they still have impact on real lives. For example Indian women knew that their favourite character in ‘Saas Bahu’ serial is fictional but still these women cried when their favourite character slept hungry. And why only these women we all must have cried sometime watching an emotional scene. We cry even though we know its fake. We know its fake but we still don’t know its fake. Its like our brain can’t distinguish between women sleeping hungry on a screen and a women sleeping hungry in front of your house. And why shouldn’t our brain believe whatever it sees in TV screen? for millions of years our brain has gone through evolution to see reality through eyes. TV screens are new, it won’t be that easy for our brains to distinguish between the picture shown on TV screen and life outside it. For our brain both are reality.
</p>
<p>
<b>Ear:</b> Music! similar to TV screens, our brains can’t distinguish between what it listens on earphone from what it listen from its real surroundings. Even a weak man can feel powerful by listening to ‘Dance of the nights’. will write more on EVIL effects of music on us in next article.
</p>
<p>
<b>Skin:</b> Yes, by using devices which give <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPnHzQ7qJ2Y"  target="_blank" rel="noopener">Haptic feedback.</a> one can get the feeling of simulated touch. Another example can be seen in pilot training, in order to reduce the cost involved in setting up a full size cockpit mockup, a device which gives haptic feedback is used to <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/pilot-training-simulator-vr-haptic-touch/"  target="_blank" rel="noopener">train pilots.</a>
</p>

<a href=../pix/290921/haptics.jpeg><img width="300" height="300" src="../pix/290921/haptics.jpeg" alt="Haptics Feedback"></a>
</center>
</br>
<p>
<b>Smell:</b> Yes electronically generated fake smell does <a href="https://youtu.be/GLvqk8Hmcqs"  target="_blank" rel="noopener"> exist.</a>
</p>
<p>
<b>Taste:</b> Yes, electronically generated taste does <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSJ63KXyMqU"  target="_blank" rel="noopener">exist</a> to fool your body in believing that one is really eating something. With this device you just have to stick your tongue with a plugged in circuit board and that’s it you can now taste electronically generated Sweetness, Sourness or Bitterness.
</p>
<h3>
Creating matrix paradise with VR sets
</h3>

<a href=../pix/290921/senpai.jpeg><img width="300" height="400" src="../pix/290921/senpai.jpeg" alt="senpai"></a>
</center>
<p>
Previously we saw how TV creates matrix by fooling our Eyes and how music fools our Ears and so on. But their limitation is that they are only able to form a partial matrix as they only exploit one or two senses. They are not able to form complete matrix where a person can loose his complete touch with reality. A successful matrix can only be the one where a person looses his complete touch with reality and enter into simulation. In a full matrix, simulation must become a complete Perceived Real. Here I’m optimistic with VR technology. It combines all the small matrix (screen, sound etc.) to create a <a href="https://img-9gag-fun.9cache.com/photo/aGpm930_460svav1.mp4"  target="_blank" rel="noopener">full matrix.</a> See <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS43PEn7lEE"  target="_blank" rel="noopener">this</a> funny example from the Onion, here except smell (and taste. but do you need taste for that?) the person enters into a matrix. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LH8bMx66bfY"  target="_blank" rel="noopener">these</a> are some other funny examples which shows how one looses touch with reality and enter into matrix by using VR. Even after its success i believe it will at least two decades for VR technology to create a real matrix. and a time will come where we humans will spend most of our lives living in a full matrix, something similar to the Matrix movie.

<title>Blop  Better way to manage your blog</title>
<guid>https://arjunyadav.xyz/posts/blop--better-way-to-manage-your-blog.html</guid>
<pubDate>Fri, 08 Oct 2021 19:00:58 +0530</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<p>When you have made a simple blog website built up of pure html and css like mine. You will find it consuming lot of time just to constantly update your blog list on the website. And sooner or later you will be encountered by something called <a href="https://jamstack.org/generators/">static site generators</a>. Although ssg’s like Hugo are really famous and lot of people use them, they still contain 100 things out of which the users only use 2. Also at times big ssg’s can be quite complicated to use. I spent two days trying to make a static blog site with multiple ssg’s but if failed at understanding how they actually work. But after doing some search i came across [blop] (https://gitlab.com/uoou/blop/-/tree/master).</p>
<p>Blop is simply a bash script made by [uoou] (https://friendo.monster/) which creates a static website from markdown files. It is simple and customisable. (However I’ve still not figured out how to create multiple blog list)</p>
<h3 id="steps-to-make-your-static-blog-using-blop">Steps to make your static blog using Blop:</h3>
<p>1- Download zip file of the example site from [this] (https://gitlab.com/uoou/blop_blog/tree/master/public) repository and unzip it. We are downloading the example site instead of making each file ourselves is that everything in example site is customisable and will be more efficient to change that example site than making everything ourselves.</p>
<p>2- Now as we have downloaded and unzipped the example site we can move to download Blop from [this] (https://gitlab.com/uoou/blop/-/tree/master) repository. unzip the file and paste blop in your $PATH directory or just paste the blop in your example site folder if you don’t know what $PATH is.</p>
<p>3- After doing step one and two your example site folder should look like this:</p>
<center>
<p><a href=../pix/Blop3.png><img width="500" height="300" src="../pix/Blop3.png" alt="Blop"></a></p>
<p>4- Open terminal in folder and make blop executable by running the command <code>chomd +x blop</code></p>
<p>5- Now everything is ready to make our static site. But still files in current directory is from example site. You can click on index.html to see example site. But you can also edit ‘index_template.html’ (this is template for your index.html) similarly ‘archive_template.html’ is template for your blog list and ‘post_template.html’ is template for your blog post. You might also like to change ‘style.css’</p>
<p>6- When you are done with editing different templates the next step is to add your own post. In order to do this you have to delete all markdown files from the markdown folder (This folder includes .md of all your posts) and add your own .md files. Believe me markdown is more efficient to use than html. note that markdown can be limiting when you are working with images (Like setting width and height of images) in that case you can use ‘img’ tag of html in .md files and blop will without any problem convert them into html.</p>
<p>Moreover, If you are trying to move your previously written blog to blop you can directly add you old html blog files in markdown folder and Blop will still work. However Blop will mess your blog publish dates. (i don’t know its solution if you do then please share it with me)</p>
<p>7- Now comes the ‘image’ folder, you can rename it to whatever you want, Blop won’t mess up with it.</p>
<p>8- Run ‘blop’ in main directory. (public) Hopefully everything will be done right.</p>
<h3 id="configuring-site.config">Configuring site.config</h3>
<p>By default sight.config will look like this:</p>
<p>‘max_posts: 11 listing_format: <a href="posts/<!--title-nospaces-->.html"><!--title--></a> <em>by</em> <!--author--> <em>on</em> <!--date--> default_author: Skairipa’</p>
<p>1- Here ‘max post’ means the number of posts will be shown on ‘index.html’ you can change 11 to 4,3,5 etc.</p>
<p>2- In ‘listing format’ you can remove ‘<em>by</em> <!--author-->’ to remove your name from repeating after every blog post as it is obvious tht its your blog Donald Trump wont be posting on your website. (It can be useful when multiple people are making posts on your website)</p>
<p>3- Change ‘Default author’ name to yours.</p>
<p>4- Additional you can also add custom date format by adding this line: ‘date_format: %d-%m-%Y’</p>
<p>If you need help at any stage of setting up blop feel free to disturb me at me Email. And if you are good at bash and know how to add multiple <!--archive list--> to blop, do share it with me.</p>]]></description>

<title>Why is everything written on 3rd October</title>
<guid>https://arjunyadav.xyz/posts/why-is-everything-written-on-3rd-october.html</guid>
<pubDate>Mon, 04 Oct 2021 21:27:10 +0530</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<p>You can see that everything written before this post shows that it was posted on 3rd October 2021. That is partially true. Yes every post is (re)posted on 3rd October 2021, but they were actually written in a time span of last 3 months. Previously my website was showing correct published dates but yesterday i had to go through some big changes in the way i manage this website. I had to change my way because previously i was managing my website like a cave man. Literally doing everything manually. I would write every post in plain html, write each post’s header and footer manually, and finally i updated my website entry of each post manually. I did everything manually just because i didn’t wanted to use Wordpress and I wasn’t either satisfied with Hugo and other static site builders because of their over complicated usage and their approach of doing too much magic. I just needed something to manage my blog. nothing more than that and finally after two sleepless nights i came across a simple 130 line bash script which did exactly what i wanted it to do i.e Just convert markdown into html and update the entry on website. Nothing more nothing less.</p>
<p>Finally, This new and better way of managing my website has resulted in one minor inconvenience of showing all my previously written articles to be published on 3rd October 2021.</p>]]></description>

<title>Stock market story</title>
<guid>https://arjunyadav.xyz/posts/stock-market-story.html</guid>
<pubDate>Sun, 03 Oct 2021 17:28:22 +0530</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<html lang="en">
<body>
<p>
<p>instead of directly criticizing stock market i would first share an small instance: <br/> <br/></p>
<p>himanshu a 27 years old software engineer is currently working from home because of lockdown. in that ‘work from home’ he has only minimal work to do as his company is currently not engaging in it’s main operations. now our guy, himanshu is an average nice middle class worker. at home, not working, when himanshu is bored he moves his attention towards Netflix or watches cricket match on T.V. one day while watching cricket match he pays attention to an advertisement of a stock market broker. the ad can be concluded with this: a weak man who can’t even touch his toes can also trade with stocks using broker’s easy to use platform. <br/> <img src="../pix/mancan'ttouchtoe.jpg" alt="upstox" class="resmid"> <br/></p>
<p>there is also another ad of the same broker which himanshu saw: an unemployed 25 year old fat man who can’t even catch cricket ball can also trade with stocks using broker’s easy to use platform. <br/> <br/></p>
<p>himanshu thought why shouldn’t he give it a try? after all it’s easy money, he just have to buy and sell stocks and one day he will become millionaire. himanshu recalls that in his teenage he wanted to become like warren buffet, but because of family pressure he had to do engineering, now he can finally follow his passion and become next warren buffet. <br/> <br/></p>
<p>now after a long ‘research’ on YouTube himanshu finds the best broker and opens his account with a referral link which was provided by some youtuber who promoted the broker for his own incentive. poor himanshu thought that the youtuber was genuinely advicing the best broker. however, this broker is no better than the other brokers but the only thing which is good is the persuasion skills of the youtuber who advertised it. <br/> <br/></p>
<p>now as the work of opining a trading account is complete, the second work is to choose the stocks. himanshu right away refused to buy stocks of his own company as he know that the management of his company is corrupt and they will sooner or later destroy the company. so he starts looking on internet and on news to buy stocks. on news he finds some stocks which are claimed by the anchor that their value will increase more than 50% within few weeks.(just like a second hand cars salesman, that anchor was advertising the stocks. after all he has been paid to talk like that.)he finally chooses some trending stocks which everyone is buying and invests his one month salary into it. <br/> <br/></p>
<p>3 months have passed since himanshu bought those shares and now his ‘investment’ turned out to be loss. he is in tension. desperately he moves to his 30 year old brother to ask advice. he starts to whine in front of his brother “i have invested my salary into stock market, my money is worth noting now. what should i do now please tell me brother. i didn’t know that stock market is this bad, please help me getting out of this trouble.” himanshu shared his whole story to his brother. <br/> <br/></p>
<p>brother replied: it’s not the stock market which is bad in your case. it is you who is ignorant.<br />
<br/> <br/></p>
<p>himanshu, now somewhat confused: how am i ignorant? i did my research before doing anything! <br/> <br/></p>
<p>brother: no it was not research you idiot! you listened to any salesman who was most able to persuade your unbacked mind. tell me the last time you made a thorough analysis of a company before investing in it? <br/> <br/></p>
<p>himanshu was confused now. <br/> <br/></p>
<p>brother continued: well yes why would you do the real research about a company when your goal is to earn only easy money! <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>himanshu was ashamed now. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>brother: listen himanshu, there are three things which you must know about stock market: <br/> <br/></p>
<p>1- in stock market the small investors don’t have any say. no matter how poorly a company is making its decisions a person with only 200 shares can’t go and advice the management to alter their decisions. a small investor has no power to take decision he only sits their and watches his investments going up and down in their values by the actions of others. it is the mere luck of the small investor if the company will make good or bad decisions. see how powerless an average stock holder is that he can’t even slightly alter the circumstances which decides the value of his investments. if one has slight dignity he shall not at all invest small amounts in stock market. the only people who enjoy control in stock market are the big investors. they are the only people who can force companies to make decisions which are beneficial for their investments. <br/> <br/></p>
<p>2- stock market is like democracy, often weak companies are voted by people as big players. as Keynes said, in stock market people don’t choose the companies which they think will perform better. but people choose the companies which they think other people will think that all other people think will be the winners. (complicated line, but stupid phenomenon) the point here I’m trying to make is that in stock market the stocks which perform better are the ones which the masses ‘think’ should perform well, not the one which deserves. a loss making company can perform better than a company with stable balance sheet in stock market and this is mostly the case. <br/> <br/></p>
<p>3- big companies spend lot of money on advertisement to keep their share value increasing. as we have seen in the recent past, when the news went viral that Facebook is going to invest in jio, all the reliance media platforms worked to create excitement in average traders to invest in reliance, as a result the stock price of reliance has almost doubled. those media houses created such image of reliance and Facebook that after their tie up no power can stop reliance. the interesting thing is that they presented this propaganda as news, as facts and people fell for it. <br/> <br/></p>
<p>after listening to this himanshu went home, completed his pending office work, closed his demat account with loss, and promised himself not to fell for advertisements again. <br/> <br/></p>

<title>Slavery with extra steps</title>
<guid>https://arjunyadav.xyz/posts/slavery-with-extra-steps.html</guid>
<pubDate>Sun, 03 Oct 2021 17:27:40 +0530</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<html lang="en">
<body>
<p>
Well, you don’t have to be a maxist to understand the depressing conditions of working population as a whole today.
</p>
<p>
In 18th century master went in search for slaves, in 21st century slaves go out in search for master. in 18th century master needed salves, in 21st century slaves need master. lot of things have changed in last two centuries but those changes are only on surface, the underlying principles are still enact. the freedom enjoyed by employees over slaves is to a certain degree a mirage or just an illusion of freedom ( https://understandingdeeppolitics.org/the-illusion-of-freedom/ ) the biggest difference between an ordinary slave of 18th century and an employee of 21st century is that the slave knew that he is a slave by force, contrary to it employee thinks he is working for his boss by his own free will.
</P>
<br/>
<h2>
cost of slavery
</h2>
<p>
Slaves are expensive machines to get the production done. slaves are not your ordinary free raw materials gifted by mother nature to its beloved capitalists. master must spend money to keep its slaves alive. unlike machines slaves can’t work 24 hours a day. they must sleep and rest (somewhere) and it becomes a necessity for the master to spend on slave’s housing. slaves also need food and clothing means more work and spending from the part of master. and if the slave is from 2021, then he also NEEDS alcohol, youtube, netfilx, social media, smartphone etc. for survival. in order to keep his slaves alive poor master not only have to spend money on their needs but also have to decide which commodities to buy for his slaves. poor master will spend his weekends watching smartphone reviews on youtube to select best value smartphone for his slaves. its unprofitable to loose slaves at young age that’s why master must also spend money on slave’s healthcare.
</p>
<p>
In traditional slavery, all slaves know that they are slaves, they know they don’t have any freedom. moreover the master, even after spending money on the survival of slaves has to bear all the resistance and criticism from the slaves.
</p>
<p>
As the wealth of a society advances and number of available commodities increase, a moment comes where yesterday’s luxuries become today’s necessities, maintaining slaves becomes increasingly expensive. which gives disincentive to continue breeding slaves and a need arises to upgrade traditional slavery. a moment must come where capitalist of the world must unite to form new slave society where slaves must be given some real and predominantly illusion of freedom in order to eliminate the cost and troubles involved in traditional slavery.
</p>
<br/>
<h2>
Slavery Delta Variant
</h2>
<p>
Learnt from the mistakes done by masters in traditional slavery. masters get incentive to give little bit freedom to their slaves, for example-
</p>
<br/>
<p>
<b>1- Housing:</b> slaves now can decide freely where they want to live (yes, kinda freedom, but employees can’t live much further from their offices otherwise they will be spending their precious free time on daily commute and extra money will be spent on petrol/gas so they must end up selecting a near by place to their office)
</p>
<p>
<b>2- Purchases from free market (like cloths, electronics etc.)</b> Free will is rare in free market, decisions of employees are mostly influenced by the advertising.
</p>
<p>
Advertising is the biggest producer, it produces the needs of useless things in the mind of employees. as a result of aggressive advertising employees end up doing the jobs they don’t like to buy the products they don’t need.
</p>
<br/>
<p>
Who follows Hinduism or Buddhism when the new normal is to follow Consumerism?
</p>
<p>
At least in traditional slavery the slaves were not affected by this consumerism disease. but consumerism act as a fuel in this new economic machine of slavery delta variant. consumerism is the driving force of modern slavery.
</p>
<p>
I’ve already written about freedom, I’ll protect myself from repeating the same thing here, If you are interested you can read it <a href=https://arjunyadav.xyz/stories/lukesmithfreedom.html>here.</a>
</p>
<br/>
<h2>
Traditional Slavery vs Slavery Delta Variant (fReE employees)
</h2>
<p>
Freedom is given to some extent to employees, but this freedom as we have already seen is just a mere mirage. even more this freedom is dangerous in the sense that it give the illusion if freedom to employees. they think they are free but in reality their decisions are influenced by other factors. our jobs have much more effect on us then we think, it decides what type of friends we would have, it predominate our thoughts when we are stuck in traffic jam, our jobs decide on what days and time we will spend with our families and so on.
</p>
<p>
When one is suffering from a disease the worst thing he can do is to live in a illusion that he is health. only when one recognizes that he is suffering he can struggle to find a cure. that’s why i said previously that at least slaves knew that they have no freedom. that recognition, and only that led to their emancipation. but today’s employees are enjoying their illusion of freedom while in reality they continue to suffer slavery!

<title>Selling unfinished products is new normal</title>
<guid>https://arjunyadav.xyz/posts/selling-unfinished-products-is-new-normal.html</guid>
<pubDate>Sun, 03 Oct 2021 17:26:50 +0530</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<html lang="en">
<body>
<p>
recently i decided to buy a new cycle for me. i choose to buy it from decathlon. the cheapest one. they provide good quality cycles, at least that’s what everyone said. so after deciding what i want to buy and from whom, i went to their store. rode it for a while in the store to check if everything is working fine before paying them. everything was fine, almost. there were parts missing. a lot of parts were missing from that cycle, no mudguard, there was option for water bottle holder but i can see no holder attached to it. no bell, not even cycle stand can be found on it! i thought they will assemble everything at checkout service. that these are just unfinished products. was i wrong? i was.
</p>
<p>
at checkout:
</p>
<p>
I: how much is the price again?<br/> salesman: 5k<br/> I: OK i’m making the payment, you tell them to assemble it. salesman: assemble? it’s already assembled.<br/> I: i’m talking about the parts like mudguard, ring, stand and others salesman: sir, they are accessories.<br/> I: accessories? stand is a accessory? do you want me to just drop my cycle on the road while i go to some store? stand is not a accessory but a necessity!<br/> salesman: if you want the accessories we can add them.<br/> I: and how much will they cost me?<br/> salesman: mudguard is for rs500, water bottle holder is for rs200, water bottle is for rs200, bell is for rs200, seat cover is for rs150, stand is for rs500…your total will be rs6200<br/> I: a stand for rs500, in the market it costs only rs150 to buy it!<br/> salesman: it is what it is. <br/> I: if the complete product costs 6200 then why are you claiming it to be for 5000?<br/> salesman: umm..ahhh…company decides it…
</p>
<img src="../pix/soycle.jpg" class="resmid"> <br>
<h3>
understanding the problem
</h3>
<p>
cycle industry is the case of monopolistic competition. decathlon is not the only company selling cycles. there are other competitors like hero, atlas, Firefox and many more. they do not sell completely identical products but at the end they are just cycles with different marketing groups. charging only rs500 more than the competitor can lead the costumer to choose the other brand. this is cut throat competition.
</p>
<p>
hence to fight competition companies have these three options:
</p>
<p>
first,is to charge lower price to attract costumers. but it has the downside that it will reduce the companies’s profit even more and company may also has to incur loss because in competition companies already earn only average revenue. average revenue is just enough for the survival for the company. reducing average revenue by lowering the prices will be a sure recipe to enter into company closure.
</p>
<p>
second, do better marketing than the competition. make people see beautiful imaginary lands in the company logo like the devotes see god in murti (statue) which are made up of stones. something which the apple has successfully done. but only if it was that easy to build brand image like apple every company would have done it.
</p>
<p>
third, “the necessary result of this competition is a general deterioration of commodities, adulteration, fake production and universal poisoning.”(karl marx) so if reducing the price will lead to loss and brand image building is easier said then done, then why not just use inferior raw materials to reduce cost and earn surplus profit. but making inferior quality products and selling them to costumers does not work in long run. as the saying goes: you can fool some of the people all the time, some of the people some of the time, but can’t fool all the people all the time. costumers in long run can find which product is good for price and which is not. so this option does’t work either.
</p>
<br/>
<h3>
the fourth way: my way or highway
</h3>
<br/>
<p>
the companies have found the most evil solution. to understand this solution.<br/> we must first review the problems from the perspective of the cycle companies:
</p>
<p>
1- if they increase price they will loose consumer.
</p>
<p>
2- if they decrease price they will loose profit.
</p>
<p>
so if the price is the only problem then why not just reduce the price and still earn profit. how?<br/> by reducing the product.<br/> how to reduce product?<br/> remove the mudguard etc. and it will lower the price. consumer is fool. he will think that our cycle is cheaper than the other and fall in the trap of buying it.
</p>
<p>
and, company will reduce the price of this unfinished product so much that it will earn only minimal profit.
</p>
<p>
but then what’s the point of selling unfinished product if the company earns only minimal profit?<br/> the unfinished product (cycle) is just a trap. the company will earn surplus profit from it’s accessories. company will overcharge on it’s accessories. the cycle will be reduced to only an instrument by which the company will sell the overpriced accessories. once the costumer buys unfinished cycle the cycle company gets monopoly over it’s accessories which enables the company to overcharge for it’s accessories. and earn surplus profit by exploiting it’s costumers without letting them know.
</p>
<p>
this technique of selling unfinished products at lower price than competition and then earning surplus profit from accessories is not limited to only cycle industry. we can see the same happening in car, motorbike industry too. everywhere the basic price to acquire a product is reasonable but when price of accessories are added to them, the products turns out to be overpriced. that’s why car accessories are overpriced, because the company earns more profit from it’s accessories than the real product.(car)
</p>
<p>
company likes to call them accessories but in reality they are necessities. and the company know this. it knows without these necessities their product is useless so the costumers will have to buy the overpriced accessories in order to use the product.
</p>

<title>Poisoning of the mind</title>
<guid>https://arjunyadav.xyz/posts/poisoning-of-the-mind.html</guid>
<pubDate>Sun, 03 Oct 2021 17:25:54 +0530</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<html lang="en">
<body>
<p>
<p>from books being the hobby of only rich people to mass printing, and from village halls to internet, a lot has been changed. 100 years ago the means of getting information were so less that the question was “how to get information”. and now an average man is surrounded by so many equipments of getting information that now the question is not “how to get information” but “what information to get”. <br/> <br/></p>
<p>it is easier now than ever to get one’s mind preoccupied by irrelevant ideas. ideas which have nothing to do with one’s real life situation. for example we can see people spending their valuable time on internet by defending irrelevant ideologies. these irrelevant ideologies are noting but parasites, they only flourish on internet and in the mind of internet users. what terrifying is that the person in whose mind these ideas live, forgets his real self and starts to identify himself with political ideologies. these parasite ideas are not only restricted to political ideologies they can also include choosing a group between religion vs atheism, this gender vs that gender, Linux vs windows groups etc. the point of these parasites is to occupy the mind of man. under the occupation of these parasites man goes farther and farther away from reality. and only sees the picture of the world through the filter of these parasites. <br/> <br/></p>
<p>to further explain what i mean by “seeing the world from the filter of these parasites” lets see a recent <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/06/02/americans-in-news-media-bubbles-think-differently-about-foreign-policy-than-others/">work</a> done by pew research, where pew research found how people who are stuck in media bubbles have irrational stands about different problems, viewers of both CNN and fox news bubble have irrational opinions. this research also shows how the people who are stuck in media bubbles loose their ability to think critically. this is the poisoning of mind. CNN and fox news both are like parasites which live in the mind of their viewers. their viewers forget that world exists beyond democrats and republicans. viewers forgets other aspects of life and only talk about politics all the time. the question is do the viewrs really need to feed that much propaganda to their brain? is this much dose of irrelevant politics is good for mental health? <br/> <br/></p>
<p>more than a century ago, Arthur Schopenhauer, in his work ‘on books and reading’, wrote how a man poisons his mind by reading books of poor content i.e books of popular culture fiction, religious and political pamphlets etc. Arthur advices to learn the art of refraining from reading poor content of popular culture. he further claims that “the man who writes for fools is always sure of a large audience”. what one should do is to read great minds of all ages not all minds of current age. by this way, and only by this way one can prevent one’s mind from getting poisoning from poor content. <br/> <br/></p>
<p>back in the days people suffered because of less information now people are suffering from too much information. but if we compare two man, one from current times to the one from older times, the man from older times would be better off as at least his mind was not filled with the propaganda provided by different political groups and businesses. <br/> <br/> it is the skill of refraining which a man should learn now. thanks to technological advancements that there are way more things today which a man can read and watch which were unimaginable yesterday. the question shall not only be what to be read and watched but also what NOT to be read or watched.</p>

<title>Marketing is bloat business marketing rant</title>
<guid>https://arjunyadav.xyz/posts/marketing-is-bloat-business-marketing-rant.html</guid>

<p>
marketing is considered to be one of the most essential part of business these days, business spend big chunk of their resources into marketing in order to fill their “sales tunnel”. most of the time the percentage of total cost spent on marketing alone is really high, And oh boy, this percentage of resource spending reaches dangerous heights when we analyse it in monopolistic competition.
</p>
<p>
I’m going to ask three questions-<br/> 1- why spend on marketing?<br/> 2- who actually pays for the increased marketing coasts?<br/> 3-Alternative to spending on business marketing department?
</p>
<p>
1- why spend on marketing? Well easy question, businesses spend on marketing in order to create public awareness about their commodity, if more people know about their commodities more people will be interested in buying their commodities, if more people are buying their commodities the owners will take more money to their homes. As competition in some market increase things become even worse now spend more on marketing or get out of business. but this is only free hand side of marketing, it has some consequences as well. Spending on marketing activity increases the overall production cost!!!!
</p>
<p>
2- who pays for this increased marketing cost? You and me, we the consumers have to pay for this increased overall production cost. We like to blame inflation for increased prices but what about those stupid costs which are incurred by every business which no one but the end consumer has to pay! Ok there are many things which increases the prices of things and stupid marketing costs are definitely one of them.
</p>
<p>
3-Alternative to spending on business marketing department? It’s better to increase the money on r&amp;d and real product development rather than hiring one more marketing guy! In the long run by spending more money on r&amp;d will help us to find efficient ways to build a product. It will result in decrease costs will means more profit for business!

<title>Market and education</title>
<guid>https://arjunyadav.xyz/posts/market-and-education.html</guid>

<p>
the magical wizard of capitalism commodifies everything it touches. unfortunately even education wasn’t able to protect itself from the spell of that wizard. consequences of commodification of education are depressing. however the degradation of education seems to be a necessary condition to satisfy the hunger of market.
</p>
<br/> <br/>
<h2>
market oriented approach of education institutions
</h2>
<br/>
<p>
to compete with other universities and in order to show higher job placement percentage universities restrict their course list to what is demanded by the market. seeking truth is no more the goal of education. a study which only seeks truth has nothing worthy in it if it doesn’t satisfy the demand of market, the demand of employers! <br/> <br/> tell me how many private colleges in India are offering graduation in Urdu, Hindi, philosophy etc.? <br/> <br/> the number of students who take for example Urdu as their subject in their school and colleges is dwindling very fast. on this rashid says:
</p>
<br/> <br/>
<p style="text-align:center">
<i>Maangey Allah se bas itni dua hai Rashid <br/> Main jo Urdu mein vaseeyat likhoon beta parh ley</i> <br/> <br/> All rashid asks for Allah is just one small gift: <br/> If I write my will in Urdu, may my son be able to read it.
</p>
<br/> <br/>
<p>
nevertheless, Urdu continues to be extensively quoted in debates, and it remains to be the most quotable of all Indian languages. khurshid Afsar Bisrani puts it aptly:
</p>
<br/> <br/>
<p style="text-align:center">
<i>Ab Urdu Kya hai ek koothey ki tawaif hai <br/> mazaa har ek leta hai mohabbat kaun karta hai</i> <br/> <br/> what is Urdu now but a whore in whorehouse <br/> whoever wants has fun with her, very few love her
</p>
<br/> <br/>
<p>
at the ends it turns out that both universities and students have submitted themselves to the market. market decides what universities should offer and what students should learn. people blame communism for forcing their decisions on people, just see what the market is doing!
</p>
<br/> <br/>
<h2>
effect on man
</h2>
<br/>
<p>
now man is no more a tool making animal but a tool itself. and because of its easily molding characteristics this tool comes in multiple varieties like software engineer, mechanical engineer, business administrator etc. <br/> <br/> now man no more studies what he likes but only what is liked by the market.

<title>Critique of luke smith's freedom</title>
<guid>https://arjunyadav.xyz/posts/critique-of-luke-smith's-freedom.html</guid>
<pubDate>Sun, 03 Oct 2021 17:22:58 +0530</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<html lang="en">
<body>
<p>
in his recent <a href="https://lukesmith.xyz/articles/modern-freedom-means-being-a-slave-to-impulses">work</a> Luke smith, while explaining freedom, writes:<br/> “Christians stated the classical view of freedom very clearly. Paul writes that all men are either”slaves to Christ" or “slaves to sin.” The modern man wants to retort that he does’t want to be a slave to anything, but wants to be his own master, but there is really no such thing.
</p>
<p>
One can be guided by Christ, or more generally, by consistent moral principles, restraint and forethought. Or one can abandon the pretense of morality and by definition follow his impulses to fornication, substance-abuse, and general reckless living. "
</p>
<p>
it is clear from his work that, what Luke is trying to say here is: man is either first,a slave of god or second, a slave of impulses. and there is no middle ground i.e man is not free. man can’t think for himself. man needs a master to tell him what to do.
</p>
<p>
in first case, god tells man what good things man has to do to get emancipation from the evil.(the problem here is that there is not only one god in this world, but multiple. who have mostly contradictory rules of do’s and don’t’s) for example a Hindu will listen to his god and will not harm the weak, don’t act cowardly, perform his responsibilities and so on.
</p>
<p>
in the second case, instead of listing to god. man becomes rebellious, denies the existence of god. and sets the belief of listing to himself. but according to Luke, man is slave to his impulses hence he only listens to his impulses. for example doing drugs, checking social media every 5 minutes, being watching movies and so on. the point here is that man thinks he is free but he is slave to his impulses.
</p>
<p>
unfortunately Luke the unaboomer is wrong.
</p>
<p class="sub">
man is not just impulses
</p>
<p>
i say Luke only finds fault in man only to give himself reason to do slavery of god. when Luke says man is slave to his impulses, he only sees the animal part of the man. man is more than just impulses. man is a conscious being. who can think. who can decide. who can act rationally. animal on the other hand are the real slaves of impulses. eat, sleep, reproduce is what all they think but man is different from them. man is an animal who can think. but according to Luke man is only an animal i.e a slave to impulses.
</p>
<p>
as karl marx wrote:<br/> “The animal is immediately one with its life activity. It does not distinguish itself from it. It is its life activity. Man makes his life activity itself the object of his will and of his consciousness. He has conscious life activity. It is not a determination with which he directly merges. Conscious life activity distinguishes man immediately from animal life activity. It is just because of this that he is a species-being. Or it is only because he is a species-being that he is a conscious being, i.e., that his own life is an object for him. Only because of that is his activity free activity.”
</p>
<p>
if man is just a slave to impulses then why not all people watch t.v. 10 hours a day? there are always some addict who do watch t.v. 10 hours a day but most of us don’t. because we can think. we can think it’s unhealthy and there are other responsibilities which are need to be fulfilled. but if we follow Luke’s idea and see man as just a slave of impulses everyone should be watching t.v. 10 hours a day. which is wrong.
</p>
<p class="sub">
does religion gives all the answers?
</p>
<p>
multiple religions with different philosophies. often contradictory. then how do you decide which one to follow? or which one is right? the debate on these questions are continuing from the dawn of the time but no one has found a compelling answer.
</p>
<p>
can Luke smith’s bible tell how much hours of internet consumption is good and how much is evil? can Luke smith’s bible tell how much McDonald consumption is good and how much is evil?
</p>
<p>
yes the exact answers to these questions can not be found in religious books. that’s where human thinking comes. man thinks how much consumption is good and how much is unhealthy.man does not need religion to answer these and other question. it’s common sense.
</p>
<p>
the why even bother doing slavery of god when man can take control of his impulses by just thinking?
</p>
<p>
perhaps Luke smith answer this question by saying “going to church is cool” or “all the cool kids are religious” and so on. Luke smith is the kind of guy who would do slavery just to look cool on internet.
</p>
<p class="sub">
the real solution to get freedom: take responsibility and be free
</p>
<p>
a kid is a slave to his parents. in the sense that he has to eat and do what his parents decide. because he is not mature enough to think for himself. but as he grows, he starts to think, makes decisions, and he is also held accountable for his actions. his parents gives him more freedom to decide what’s better for him. for example giving him the freedom to decide his course in college etc. and that kid gets complete freedom when he starts to earn money. now his parents no more tell him what to eat and what not to. if he in his adult age eat chocolate all the time it’s he who is responsible for his ill health. but now as he is adult and knows all the ill effects of eating too much chocolate he no more eats them. he is free to decide. but taking right decisions is his responsibility. if he can not take right decisions. his freedom must be taken back. doctors will force him to stick to healthy diet. the moment he fails to take responsibility he looses his freedom.
</p>
<p>
hence taking responsibility is the only way to get freedom.
</p>
<p>
when stuck in problem, take responsibility and find solution. and if the solution does’t work, take responsibility of your failure. only in this way freedom can be achieved.
</p>
<p>
finally,
</p>
<p>
1- a man who is slave to his impulses is not a man but animal and should be called one.<br/> 2- being slave to god is better than being slave to impulses. but still not free yet.<br/> 3- thinking,making decisions, taking responsibility of your actions is true freedom. this is what distinguishes us from animals who are slave of impulses.

<title>Cool trick to install software via apt package manager</title>
<guid>https://arjunyadav.xyz/posts/cool-trick-to-install-software-via-apt-package-manager.html</guid>
<pubDate>Sun, 03 Oct 2021 17:22:08 +0530</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<html lang="en">
<body>
<p>
<p>to install software via apt in debian and debian based distros you have to type “sudo apt install foo” however there are two problems with this: <br/> <br/> 1- you have to know the exact name of the package you want to install <br/> <br/></p>
<p>2- you have to type “sudo apt install foo” which is somewhat long. <br/> <br/> there is a cool trick which someone posted on reddit.(and i can’t remember the exact source at this moment) <br/> <br/></p>
<p>paste this code in terminal: <br/> <br/> <code> apt-cache search "" | sort | cut –delimiter " " –fields 1 | fzf –multi –cycle –reverse –preview “apt-cache show {1}” –preview-window=:57%:wrap:rounded:hidden –bind=space:toggle-preview | xargs -r sudo apt install -y </code> <br/> <br/> <a href=../pix/fapt.png><img class=resmid src="../pix/fapt.png" alt="fapt"></a> <br/> </br></p>
<p>(ofcourse you can make a simple script or make alias of this big command to make it short) <br/> <br/> technically he just added apt repository with fuzzy finder, but no one had ever thought of doing this simple thing, and that’s why i’m thankful to the guy who originally posted this on reddit.</p>
<p><br/> <br/> prerequisite: <br/> <br/> you should have fzf installed in order to use it.</p>

<title>Jo bikta hai wahi dikhta hai</title>
<guid>https://arjunyadav.xyz/posts/jo-bikta-hai-wahi-dikhta-hai.html</guid>
<pubDate>Sun, 03 Oct 2021 17:21:10 +0530</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<html lang="en">
<body>
<p>
<p>there is a famous proverb “jo dikhta hai wo bikta hai”. meaning that what gets marketed, gets sold.(giving it a business sense).wrong! for a moment let’s be a Marxist and turn the tables and say “jo bikta hai wahi dikhta hai” meaning: the thing which gets sold, is the one which exists.(everything else dies over time) <br/> <br/></p>
<p>by this i mean, survival of the fittest in the market. take for example the keypad phones of blackberry from 2009, which back than had a big market share. why isn’t the keypad phones from blackberry still dominating the market? if we listen to the first proverb, we would blame the poor marketing strategy from the blackerry’s part. however that’s not the case. people don’t use blackberry anymore not because blackberry didn’t spend much on marketing but because people had found new technology of touch screen smartphones. blackberry tried promoting their keypad phones and failed. in 2021 blackberry is nowhere to be seen.(it still exists but would to call it an existence?) <br/> <br/></p>
<p>the answer can be found in our new proverb. as Adam Smith says, increase in profit leads to increase in investment and increase in investment leads to increase in innovation. people in 2009 found the new touch screen phones, even though the ‘smartphones’ were barely in a workable state as they are now but people’s trust(purchase) in them lead to the flow of investment in smartphone industry and they continued to improve. on the other hand companies like blackberry and Nokia failed to mold themselves according to this new market. their sales continued to drop and by the time they realized that they are late it was already too late. today the reason teenage girls are able to make tiktok videos on their smart phones is because in 2009 people had put their money on these touch screen smartphones. people voted by their money for the thriving existence of smart phones and for the murder of blackberry.(and murder of the other keypad phones) <br/> <br/></p>
<p>capital is the life line of any product. investors provide capital. profit is the only criteria which incentivize or dis-incentivize the investors for investing. and profit depends on whether the product is getting sold or not sales depends on whether the product is relivent for the market or not. reduction in relivancy leads to reduction in sales, reduction in sales leads to reduction in profit, which leads to reduction in capital, reduction in capital leads to winding up of the company. <br/> <br/></p>
<p>market is no different from the natural world. only the fittest survives. the only product which exists is the one which is strong enough to satisfy the wants of the market. i.e the one which gets sold, is the one which exists. <br/> <br/></p>

<title>The Tiktok Want</title>
<guid>https://arjunyadav.xyz/posts/the-tiktok-want.html</guid>
<pubDate>Sun, 03 Oct 2021 17:19:56 +0530</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<html lang="en">

<p>
<p>it’s been almost a year since Indian government banned TikTok. what is interesting here is that tiktok was banned not only because of political reasons but also because of social reasons. people, especially the ones with power thought that tiktok is degenerating their youth. but these boomers forgot that it was the ‘social’ who was responsible for the tiktok i.e it was the market which had a need for an app like tiktok. market needed an app which can provide easy to consume 15 seconds long videos which are full of stimulus and most importantly super easy to edit. tiktok fulfilled this need.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>what has been the consequence of their decision? one year ago they banned one tiktok now there are over a dozen of tiktoks in the market. previously there was almost a monopoly of tiktok in this market. now different apps like moj, josh, mxtakatak etc.[1] are jumping like monkeys to get a bigger share of this newly vacated market. just look at the top charts of play store or app store, you can find plenty of these apps jumping there. before tiktok ban these apps didn’t even existed, or the ones which existed knew that they have lost this battle against tiktok. these apps, however with different names, are all the same. they are trying to satisfy the same want, the ‘tiktok want’: easy to consume 15 second long videos which are full of stimulus and most importantly super easy to edit.</br> </br></p>
<p>bigger players like youtube and facebook also know the significance of this newly generated ‘tiktok want’. so they created their own tiktoks- what do you think youtube shorts are? and what are facebook stories? or insagram stories? or maybe whatsapp status? and damn now even twitter has its stories! different name has been given to this evil need but goal is same i.e to satisfy the ‘tiktok want’: easy to consume 15 second long videos which are full of stimulus and most importantly super easy to edit.</br> </br></p>
<p>these new tiktok apps are laughing on the face of those old people who thought that banning tiktok would be the solution of those poor circumstances. little did our boomers knew that this ‘tiktok want’ virus is soon going to take over their daily apps. now the boomers themselves are updating their whatsapp status which is edited by one of these tiktok apps. it turns out that tiktok is not just an app, it is a need (or a crude want) which is demanded by the market. tiktok can be banned from the market but the ‘tiktok want’ can not be banned from the hearts of the people.</br></p>
<p></br></p>
<p>when prostitution is the problem you don’t ban a single prostitute but the whole activity of prostitution. when ‘tiktok want’ is the problem you don’t ban a single tiktok but have to ban the whole activity which is related with the satisfaction of ‘tiktok want’. which in current circumstances seems not to be possible.</br></p>

notes:</br> [1] these apps have funny names but the times are depressing.</br></p>

<title>So you want to buy a dog </title>
<guid>https://arjunyadav.xyz/posts/so-you-want-to-buy-a-dog-.html</guid>
<pubDate>Sun, 03 Oct 2021 16:31:52 +0530</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<html lang="en">
<head>
<body>
<p style="margin-top: 1em">
dog lovers of the world, read my work. here i write my frustration about modern breding practices and idiot dog owners. i hope this work will help you in making better decison regarding dogs in future.
</p>
<h2>
<p>unfortunate times</p>
</h2>
<p style="margin-top: 1em">
as rule of thumb when you combine dumb people with free markets it results into degradation of commodities. music which previously nourished the soul of it’s listeners has now been degraded to simply stimulus noise. just see the top trending music these days. now dogs are also getting freely traded in the market. what happened with music also happened with dogs. the dogs which previously protected the house of it’s owner are now degraded to clowns for Instagram. or the dogs which were previously bred for work are now (mostly) being bred for looks, only looks. and the only reason why dogs are getting bred for looks is the market. the market, especially the dumb section of it decides to buy dogs only because they look good. that forces the dog breeders to breed dogs for looks.
</p>
<p style="margin-top: 1em">
effect of breeding dog for mere looks on different dog breeds:
</p>
<p style="margin-top: 1em">
1- german shepherds which were initially bred for courage, intelligence and muscular strength now being destroyed because of the poor breeding of this dog now german shepherds have problems including: hip dysplasia[1] (decease caused by the demand for sloped back german shepherds) and shyness.(because who cares about the mental health of their german shepherd until he looks good)
</p>
<p style="margin-top: 1em">
2-Chihuahuas are bred for their large head in relationship to the body. because of that: “Chihuahua puppies have to be born through cesareans, because the puppy’s heads are too big for natural birth. There are also instances of open fontanels (”Chihuahua molera“), which is seen as a breed characteristic.”
</p>
<p style="margin-top: 1em">
3- forget about diseases which have been resulted due to poor breeding. breeds like bulldogs can’t even mate naturally!!!
</p>
<p style="margin-top: 1em">
the examples of poor breeding can include any dog breed in the market. every single breed is affected by this.[2]
</p>
<h2>
lesson learned
</h2>
<p style="margin-top: 1em">
don’t buy a dog just because it looks good. see your requirements i.e size of your house, the amount of time you will be spending with the dog, the job for which you want the dog whether it’s for personal protection or live stock guarding, check if it matches with the breed you want to buy. it often happens that people buy the wrong breed for a particular job. i know few people who bought a pit bull as a live stock guardian, and as expected results were terrifying. taking pit bull as LGD is like giving wolves the responsibility of guarding the sheep.
</p>
<h2>
dog vs toy dog
</h2>
<p style="margin-top: 1em">
a dog is one who gets food because he does some work. whether it’s protection of house or live stock or maybe working at border and so on. on the other hand toy dog is one who gets food only because he looks good. a dog has to work, a toy dog has to merely exist.
</p>
<p><a href=../pix/dogvstoydog.jpg><img class=resmid src="../pix/dogvstoydog.jpg" alt="dog"></a></p>
<h2>
the best breeder in the world
</h2>
<p style="margin-top: 1em">
natural selection is the best breeder. and where it can be found? in the native breeds of your country. i’m here only talking about those native dogs who have the least human intervention in their breeding. i.e no poor selective breeding. every country has their native breeds. if possible go for them. there are multiple good reasons for that. first of all nature has made them according to the local environment, so that the chances of putting a dog made for cold weather into a hot environment can be eliminated.(there are many idiots who are breeding huskies in thar desert, India. secondly, as native dogs are made by the nature they are more healthy than those fancy toy dogs. it will save you a good chunk of money which you would have spent on your dog’s diagnosis. third, native breeds are way more cheaper than those fancy ones, and often you can just get them for free, if you know where to go.
</p>
<p style="margin-top: 1em">
but be aware that there are also many local breeders who do poor breeding of native breeds. it would be a good idea to get a native puppy from the villages where the only breeder is natural selection. and natural selection is the only breeder which can be trusted.
