          <title>Why use a note taking app?</title>
          <pubDate>Mon, 28 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

          <guid>https://arjunyadav.xyz/blog/why-use-a-note-taking-app/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Sell me Obsidian. Or any other note taking app for that matter. I want to buy it, sell me. I was influenced so much by youtube&#x27;s productivity gurus that I wanted have all my knowledge base on these apps. I tried things like Obsidian, Joplin and so on. I don&#x27;t even remember their names now, they were so NPC.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After trying all these, one after other, I found myself continuously pulling my hairs. Jumping from one app to another. There were few problems which I was encountering in every app. See for example Joplin, it takes 10 seconds for this program to start on my laptop. 10 seconds! even Firefox snap is snappier than this. Now there is one better side of the Joplin when compared to other apps: It offers free synchronization to one drive as a basic feature without requiring any additional plugin. It offers markdown support and live preview of the document. It is the best option for my needs which I have found. That&#x27;s what I thought, until I made a todo list in it and tried to notify myself for it: On my PC I received a minor notification of the task (which I ignored) and on phone I did not even receive any notification, because on phone I forgot to open the app and sync the todo data. For Joplin devs, according to their FAQ&#x27;s background sync is not a read thing. But I didn&#x27;t lose my hope, I opened the app, did the sync, and finally got the notification. But with only caveat i.e the notification was mild that it did not get my attention and I just swiped it. Ah! Joplin was all good but for to-do the notification is not its strength.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just wanted an app where I can make notes and get some to-do notifications which can induce me to complete the tasks. I have found notifications to be quite important. Generally I can make a list of items to be done in some app or text file, but after sometime I will end up forgetting that I have even made such a list and notifications exactly eliminates that.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was losing all my hopes but then I realized that I am using Linux. &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Diya tale andhera&amp;quot;&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; (Darkness under the lamp). Why go for big apps when I can simply use markdown, vim and git combo. There are some benefits too:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&#x27;s light weight hence fast.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I already know vim.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Markdown support let&#x27;s me have more capabilities.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Git for sync&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But one thing is missing: To-do&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I finally sold my soul and tried Google Keep and I was actually surprised by its capabilities as not only a note taking thing but also a to-do list reminder. I set a sample task for test and I must say it kept reminding me to work. I tried getting rid of that notification but I couldn&#x27;t. Either I had to mark it complete or click on &#x27;later&#x27; which was forcing me to select time and date for that &#x27;later&#x27;. Of all the things I tried this was the only one option which made me really accomplish something.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&#x27;t want to use Google keep as a note taking app for the books I read. I prefer offline markdown and vim more than that. Don&#x27;t want to be in a situation where I am not able to access my notes just because I don&#x27;t have internet access at that moment.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To conclude this is what I am using:
For study notes: Vim, markdown and git
For to-do and other reminders: Google Keep&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have better solution, please do recommend me.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <title>Ban in India Ep. 2 who cares?</title>
          <pubDate>Sun, 18 Jun 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
          <author>Unknown</author>

          <guid>https://arjunyadav.xyz/blog/banprivacy/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;In this new episode of &#x27;Ban in India&#x27;, the Indian government follows its previous footsteps and this time makes a big leap by banning the concept of privacy altogether in India. Ahh, my previous statement might be an exaggeration, as some legal experts might point out, but hey, it&#x27;s still a significant attack on the average Joe&#x27;s privacy. Let&#x27;s conclude the &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tutanota.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;posts&#x2F;apps-banned-india&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;news&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; to the best of my capabilities: The Indian government has ordered all the apps that provide encrypted messaging in India must have at least one of their employees on Indian soil. This ensures that whenever the Indian authorities want any information about any user, they can easily obtain it by asking that particular individual. So, the Indian authorities are clearly asking for a backdoor. Furthermore, the authority states that apps that fail to comply will be banned from operating in India.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This request&#x2F;order&#x2F;threat from the Indian side seems quite foolish. Let&#x27;s momentarily set aside the issues of privacy and backdoors and consider this: You are a small company that provides encrypted messaging to users, and you don&#x27;t have the financial resources to establish a presence in India. But now, the Indian government wants you to have an employee on Indian land! This incurs additional expenses. And how is a small company from france with 5 employees in total going to afford that?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&#x27;s revisit the news aspect again. What&#x27;s amusing, and as people like Mental Outlaw on YouTube have already pointed out, is that Indian authorities are justifying this decision by claiming it will prevent terrorism. Really? I understand that terrorism is a serious matter, but really? Do you believe that banning encrypted messaging apps will solve terrorism? In a country like India, more people die from potholes than from terrorism. Why not focus on addressing that issue instead? or maybe terrorists also use road for travell and stuff why not ban roads too?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;tagged-by-twitter&quot;&gt;Tagged by Twitter&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As if that wasn&#x27;t enough, Jack Dorsey, &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bbc.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;world-asia-india-65886825&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;accused&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; Indian authorities of threatening to shut down Twitter and raid its employees if Twitter fails to ban the accounts demanded by Indian authorities during the farmer protests.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When even a prominent figure like Jack Dorsey couldn&#x27;t protect himself from the intimidating behavior of Indian authorities, one can only imagine the challenges faced by smaller apps with a limited user base trying to operate in India.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;who-cares-after-all&quot;&gt;Who cares after all?&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Indian government is invading its citizens&#x27; privacy. Yes, so what? Who cares?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a nation, Indian citizens are preoccupied with different topics (which I&#x27;m too scared to mention here). The average Indian Joe doesn&#x27;t prioritize privacy, encryption, or related matters. Just a year ago, the Indian government used the spy software, umm... what was it called? Ah yes! The Pegasus spyware, to surveil political opponents, critics, and journalists. But hey, I&#x27;m not aware of any widespread protest. Now they are banning encrypted apps... and I don&#x27;t see many people discussing it either. Hell, we wouldn&#x27;t have known about India banning these secure messaging apps if it weren&#x27;t for the Western media&#x2F;youtube channels bringing it to our attention.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, even though not many people read my blog, I&#x27;m still afraid to share this piece on my webpage. I&#x27;ve tried to be as polite as possible, but in India, people often label others as anti-national without a second thought. Maybe some ultra-intellectual will read this blog and say: &#x27;You are anti-national. How dare you complain about the decision to ban these apps when our government clearly stated that these apps are being used by terrorists for communication? Why do you need privacy? What do you want to hide?&#x27;. To that I would say &amp;quot;Ask your lords to ban roads too then. If there are no roads there are no bomb blasts in cars running on road either.&amp;quot;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <title>RIP Unabomber</title>
          <pubDate>Sun, 11 Jun 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

          <guid>https://arjunyadav.xyz/blog/ripunabomber/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=resright src=&quot;&#x2F;pix&#x2F;2023&#x2F;oldted.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;450&quot; height=&quot;350&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;img&gt;
The American constitution and its consequences have been a disaster for our Unabomber. It is only with great displeasure to inform you that Unabomber (Ted kaczynski) died yesterday in prison cell. Chances are that you might have already heard this disheartening news. For those unfortunate folks who are unfamiliar with his name, I must provide a small introduction of Unabomber.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ted Kaczynski or Unabomber was a studious student who got selected in Harward for bachelors in mathematics when he was 16. Later he went to pursue Ph.D. in mathematics. Smart guy right? right. Seems like with this background he is all set for academia right? no. Well, it turns out that instead of going to some prestige university to do research. He got fed up from the modern society, went into woods, made a 10X12 ft cabin, started sending bombs disguised as mail to different people predominantly in the field of acedimia. Later he wrote a famous manifesto (Industrial Society and Its Future). This manifesto alone helped him win great number of sympathisers all around the world (of course anyone who justify the killings is a psychopath).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-unabomber-s-cabin&quot;&gt;The Unabomber&#x27;s cabin&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=resleft src=&quot;&#x2F;pix&#x2F;2023&#x2F;unabombercabin.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;200&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;img&gt;
Unabomber got fed up from society and with the intent of leaving the industrial society and its consequences, Unabomber made a wooden cabin in remote Montana, USA. It lacked all industrial society&#x27;s consequences: No electricity, no computer nothing! But yes that cabin was filled with printed books. And of course there was a typewriter too to write the manifesto.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the cabin looks somewhat cozy despite the lack of modern amenities, isn&#x27;t it?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-bombings&quot;&gt;The Bombings&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ted was infamous for bombing people. That&#x27;s why the name Unabomber (University and Airline Bomber) was given by FBI to him. That is also the reason why he spent his remaining life in prison.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-manifesto&quot;&gt;The Manifesto&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1995 The Washington Post and The New York Times published Unabomber&#x27;s manifesto &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.cs.ucdavis.edu&#x2F;~rogaway&#x2F;classes&#x2F;188&#x2F;materials&#x2F;Industrial%20Society%20and%20Its%20Future.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Industrial Society and Its Future&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
by the request on Unabomber himself. The publication was a condition set by unabomber to cease his bombing campaign. This manifesto later became such a success that it became highly popular among different people. In its manifesto unabomber proposed that how the industrial society has caused suffering and alienation in society. Ted doesn&#x27;t stop there and he later in the manifesto claims that even agriculture revolution was a mistake. Moreover, he criticized left also for its childish ideas(unironically). I read this manifesto when I was 19, And boy it really sold me this idea and I became a Primitivist for few days. #teenage.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;rip-unabomber&quot;&gt;RIP Unabomber&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The news of Ted&#x27;s death was shocking but it was inevitable. When he was free he focused his efforts in spent his efforts in pursuit of freedom. He left society for nature. He left the prestige of academic career for a simple life in woods. Well not so simple if you see the complexities of the bombs. But still for simple life. He was a big proponent of freedom. In his remote cabin he enjoyed the freedom. The fact that he had to spend his last years in prison and not in open moutains is disheartening. For the things he did wrong he got punished and for the things he did right, he will be remembered for years to come. His work is more important than ever in our times, it makes us to see things(consequences) from a different lens. And after all who knows maybe that&#x27;s the right lens. RIP Unabomber!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <title>Ironic Musk&#x27;s AI Irony</title>
          <pubDate>Tue, 18 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

          <guid>https://arjunyadav.xyz/blog/ironic-musk-s-ai-irony/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Elon musk: the real life &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.imdb.com&#x2F;title&#x2F;tt9219848&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Irony Man!&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just few day ago Elon Musk along with apple co-founder Steve Wozniak and more than 1000 people from AI industry signed a &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;futureoflife.org&#x2F;open-letter&#x2F;pause-giant-ai-experiments&#x2F;&quot;&gt;petition&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; to pause the development in AI.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The petition says:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We call on all AI labs to immediately pause for at least 6 months the training of AI systems more powerful than GPT-4.&amp;quot;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this being done you might think &amp;quot;Oh Musk cares so much about humanity.&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Smart Musk knows the downside of too much AI development.&amp;quot;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But wait wait wait it&#x27;s not even one month since he signed the petition and...
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.business-standard.com&#x2F;world-news&#x2F;now-elon-musk-enters-ai-system-race-plans-company-to-rival-openai-123041600816_1.html&quot;&gt;la la la la la&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; (News headline: News headline: &amp;quot;Now, Elon Musk enters AI system race, plans company to rival OpenAI&amp;quot;)&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lets try to complete the quote from the petition which I had written earlier:
&amp;quot;We call on all AI labs to immediately pause for at least 6 months the training of AI systems more powerful than GPT-4.....So that we can get time to create our own AI. This time will give us bit of edge to actually build an AI product which can, to some degree, compete with other AI tools in the market.&amp;quot;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <title>SEBI literally 1984</title>
          <pubDate>Fri, 07 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
          <author>Unknown</author>
          <link>https://arjunyadav.xyz/blog/sebiliterally1984/</link>
          <guid>https://arjunyadav.xyz/blog/sebiliterally1984/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Literally 1984!&amp;quot; that&#x27;s what all our &#x27;best&#x27; &#x27;No 1&#x27; &#x27;Leading&#x27; &#x27;top&#x27; investment Adviser&#x2F;research analyst must be screaming right now.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;why?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;why shouldn&#x27;t they!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way investment advisers (IA)&#x2F; research analysts (RA) advertise themselves is not hidden from anyone. What I mean is the usage of words: the promises, fake claims are common in advertisements to influence investors&#x2F;consumers. After all its not a new phenomenon. Nevertheless &amp;quot;Dair aaye drust aaye&amp;quot; (Better late than never) SEBI recently issue its &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sebi.gov.in&#x2F;legal&#x2F;circulars&#x2F;apr-2023&#x2F;advertisement-code-for-investment-advisers-ia-and-research-analysts-ra-_69798.html&quot;&gt;circular&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; where it issued an advisory for the words used by these IA&#x2F;IR in their advertisements. To quote the circular:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Superlative terms such as “Best”, “No. 1”, Top Adviser&#x2F;Research Analyst,“Leading”, “One of the best amongst market leaders”, etc. so as to provide any endorsement of quality or standing of the IA&#x2F;RA. However, factual details of awards received by the IA&#x2F;RA from independent organizations may be included.&amp;quot;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now listen to the IA&#x2F;IR:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Bro its an attack on free speech! Language is the first thing every totalitarian state targets! Prohibiting us from speaking is such a neofascism. Attack on Private enterprise is a promotion for communism! Literally 1984!&amp;quot;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;img class=resmid src=&quot;&#x2F;pix&#x2F;2023&#x2F;1984.gif&quot; alt=&quot;My GIF&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; width=&quot;200&quot;&gt;

          <title>So I finally used ChatGPT</title>
          <pubDate>Sun, 22 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
          <author>Unknown</author>
          <link>https://arjunyadav.xyz/blog/chatgpt/</link>
          <guid>https://arjunyadav.xyz/blog/chatgpt/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;At first I was bit reluctant to use ChatGPT not only because of the general expected behavior of a human being to show less interest in new technology which has potential to alter the way in which the work is already done. Not from the consequence of that. I was reluctant to ChatGPT because it was asking my mobile number to signup! Yes, I understand companies these days are going pretty crazy to collect user data. moreover I understand that the devs of ChatGPT are just trying to protect it from exploitation. But still my mobile number for signing up for a service which I haven&#x27;t even tested&#x2F;decided to use in long term is too much. Sorry, I&#x27;m not interested.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ChatGPT is a new cool kid in town. Everyone was talking about it and I fell for the peer pressure. I gave my mobile number, verified everything and was ready to go.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first, I was just beating the bush by saying hi&#x2F;hello to that AI. Later I remembered someone saying that this thing can actually do programming on your behalf. I asked it to make some scripts for me. And oh boy! that actually worked! When I asked it to generate a script to automate a particular task and when it output the script, the feeling I got was similar to the moment when I used internet for the first time ever: MAGIC!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That AI is so convenient that it solved my problem within seconds which, otherwise, I would&#x27;ve spent hours on. I asked AI to make a bash script to output my internet download speed on terminal. And it generated that script within seconds:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre style=&quot;background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;#!&#x2F;bin&#x2F;bash
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;interface=$(ip route | awk &amp;#39;&#x2F;default&#x2F; { print $5 }&amp;#39;)
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;while true; do
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;    download_bytes=$(cat &#x2F;sys&#x2F;class&#x2F;net&#x2F;$interface&#x2F;statistics&#x2F;rx_bytes)
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;    sleep 1
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;    download_bytes_new=$(cat &#x2F;sys&#x2F;class&#x2F;net&#x2F;$interface&#x2F;statistics&#x2F;rx_bytes)
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;    download_bytes_transferred=$((download_bytes_new-download_bytes))
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;    download_speed_kbps=$(echo &amp;quot;scale=2;$download_bytes_transferred*8&#x2F;1024&amp;quot; | bc)
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;    echo &amp;quot;Interface: $interface&amp;quot;
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;    echo &amp;quot;Download Speed: $download_speed_kbps kbps&amp;quot;
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;done
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-i-fear&quot;&gt;what I fear?&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is the use of my brain? Should I just know how to form a sentence which can define my problem to AI? Is that enough? It seems to be.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=resmid src=&quot;&#x2F;pix&#x2F;chatgpt.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;700&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;img&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <title>Bhai ka Birthday!</title>
          <pubDate>Wed, 28 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

          <guid>https://arjunyadav.xyz/blog/bhagatsinghbirthday/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;More often than not Google celebrates the birthday of famous figures by showing their picture on its front page. I was surprised to see that there was no image of Bhagat Singh on the main page today. But anyways, its the birthday of our hero Bhagat Singh. For the ones who don&#x27;t know about Bhagat Singh : He is the symbol of bravery for many Indians and Pakistanis. Dude was born in 28 sep, 1907 and in his adulthood he became a nightmare for &#x27;samay di sarkar&#x27; (British government which was ruling India back then) He was such a pain for the government that they hanged him on 23rd march, 1931. At the time of his martyrdom he was only 23. Twenty Three! In such a short life he was able to create massive impact on India&#x27;s resistance for freedom, that even after almost a century he is still being remembered and respected by millions.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I don&#x27;t see the need of writing all of the things done by Bhagat Singh in this post. But one thing I should share is that Bhagat Singh was convicted of the murder of John Saunders and Channan Singh (which were done to take revenge). Rest you can find on the &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Bhagat_Singh&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;wikipedia&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; page.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think there is one thing of Bhagat Singh&#x27;s &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=gDE0SLOw-OI&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;fan&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; which can be criticised that they only see one side of Bhagat Singh i.e his bravery. But negelet other two qualities - his iron will and sharp intellect. As Jawaharlal Nehru said &amp;quot;He became a symbol(of bravery); the act was forgotten, the symbol(of bravery) remained.&amp;quot; On these two things (will and intellect) I would like to put some light on.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, most of the things which Bhagat Singh wrote survived and passed on. When I read those texts and saw at what age he has written them and compared that with what other freedom fighters were thinking and writing at that age, I found huge differences. For me, its hard to believe that a 16 year old boy can write something like this:&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.marxists.org&#x2F;archive&#x2F;bhagat-singh&#x2F;1923&#x2F;x01&#x2F;x01.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Problem of Punjab&#x27;s Language and Script&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; (It was written for a competition which he won and received a price of 50 rupees.)&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only writing, our hero was an avid reader too. By the age of 18 he had read Karl Marx, Mikhail Bakunin etc. at the time when reading was an expensive hobby and avaliablity of books was difficult. No doubt he was left leaning (or even anarchist). Pretty natural thing for a young intelligent boy in first half of 20th century India. He was such a bibliophile that even on his last day, when he was about to be hanged, he was reading Lenin&#x27;s book. The book he asked as his last wish from his lawyer. It is said that the management of jail allowed Bhagat Singh to read and write as they were also aware of his intellectual abilities.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bhagat Singh was so much influenced by Mikhail Bakunin that he became an atheist, in order to show reluctance to any kind of authority. One idea which Bhagat Singh followed is that anyone can be wrong irrespective of there position&#x2F;power. In his last days people who were close to him said that &amp;quot;you will start to believe in god once your end will come near and you will start to fear death&amp;quot;. But Bhagat Singh being Bhagat Singh, wrote an essay on &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.marxists.org&#x2F;archive&#x2F;bhagat-singh&#x2F;1930&#x2F;10&#x2F;05.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Why I am an Atheist&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his last moments when he was asked to remember God, he politely declined and according to the memoirs available he said this:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Sardarji, I did not take His name all my life. In fact, when I saw how the poor and the oppressed were being treated, I even rebuked Him. Now if I pray to Him, when death stares me in the face, He will say this man is a hypocrite and a coward. So, what effect will my prayer possibly have on Him? If I don&#x27;t change my opinion, at least He will concede this man was honest.&amp;quot;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me Bhagat Singh is a rare human created by nature (see I can&#x27;t say God for obvious reasons) with the combination of bravery, intellect and iron will.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One more thing I would like to share is a &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=gh7546en44Y&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;scene&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; from the movie &amp;quot;Sardar Udham Singh&amp;quot; (Sardar Udham Singh was a fan and friend of Bhagat singh who took revenge of  Jallianwala Bagh&#x27;s massacre by killing Michael O&#x27;Dwyer) The scene goes something like this:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interrogator: (says something bad about Bhagat Singh)&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sardar Udham Singh: What were you doing at the age of 23?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interrogator: (confused by the question.) &amp;quot;At the age of 23?&amp;quot;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sardar Udham Singh: yes.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interrogator: &amp;quot;I was just married...I was youngest detective constable in the force...happy days.&amp;quot;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sardar Udham Singh: &amp;quot;ha..so don&#x27;t talk anything about Bhagat Singh. You know nothing about him&amp;quot;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#x2F;pix&#x2F;bhagatsingh.jpg&gt;&lt;img class=resmid src=&quot;&#x2F;pix&#x2F;bhagatsingh.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Bhagat Singh&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <title>Exploitation of Micro Credit Need</title>
          <pubDate>Wed, 14 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

          <guid>https://arjunyadav.xyz/blog/exploitationofmicrocreditneed/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Finally! the government is taking the required measures against small credit apps.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-it-all-about&quot;&gt;What is it all about?&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before starting let me first introduce my readers to the situation (Even if you are not from India this might be good case study):&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It all started just few years ago when all of a sudden few loan apps started to emerge on app&#x2F;play store. What these companies were doing is providing small loan to its users by taking only minimal documents. These apps performed on 2-1-0 formula - two minutes to decide, one minute to transfer and no human contact and zero collateral.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of this, these apps became a massive success among individuals - no need to open your bank app or take the risk of affecting your credit score in case of failed repayment of loan. Even though Indian banking system is good - according to World Bank&#x27;s estimates 78% of Indian adults have a bank account. However, Indian banks currently don&#x27;t have any expertise in providing micro loan. This is exactly the need what these small credit apps are trying to fill.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;wild-west-of-financial-system&quot;&gt;Wild West of Financial System&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of being a new kid in the street, these apps performed in their own unregulated bubble. No one was there to judge their way of working. On the one side these apps fulfilled the need of Indian people by giving them easy access to credit but on the other hand these companies charged exorbitant interest rates and used inhumane tactics to recover their loan (There have been instances where people have committed suicide as a result of threats they received from the recollection team of these apps).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;waking-up-of-big-brother&quot;&gt;Waking Up of Big Brother&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After much talk of more than two years government is finally giving some essential orders - Government has now ordered Reserve Bank of India to create a whitelist of legal apps which will be the only ones app&#x2F;play store can host.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This seems to be a necessary step. Moreover, the demand of micro credit by Indians must be taken under consideration and adequate changes must be implemented in Indian banking system. The changes which can create ease of taking micro credit and educating the gullible citizens.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <title>I&#x27;m about to Become a Millionaire</title>

          <guid>https://arjunyadav.xyz/blog/imabouttobecomeamillionaire/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Ladies and gentleman its great pleasure to inform you that I&#x27;m about to become a millionaire. Contrary to &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jacobwsmith.xyz&#x2F;stories&#x2F;millionaires.html&quot;&gt;popular&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; belief one doesn&#x27;t necessarily need to work hard in order to become a millionaire. Instead one should be just adequately aware about the opportunities which are given in life. In my case I found the opportunity in my spam box. At first I thought its just another spam email but when I read it I realized that if I help a woman just by letting her use my bank account for temporary basis. I&#x27;ll become a millionaire once the deal is done. You will understand the scheme once you read the email:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FROM:  MRS BOHDANA ALEKSANDER&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;URGENT REPLY NEEDED AND CONFIDENTIAL&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Am Mrs Bohdana  Aleksander the wife of Mr.Danilo Aleksander (Ukraine sunflower oil &amp;amp; wheat,maize farmer ) my husband was murdered by the Russian Army troop because of the war between Russian&amp;amp; Ukraine it was so very terrible. .&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was a sunflower oil &amp;amp; wheat and maize farmer who have invested much in agriculture political opponents.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I acknowledge very well that my Husband deposited the sum of US$10.7M (TEN MILLION SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITED STATES DOLLARS) with a security and financial company here in Johannesburg South -Africa with the intention of using it for the purchase of new farm machinaries and chemical for Agricultural purpose as well as purchasing hectares of land in South Africa for his investment. I got your contact through chamber of commerce .With the high risk of staying in my country we are now on political asylum. (Refugee) me and my son we are here in South Africa, my position does not allow me to open an account or to normalize this fund to any meaningful business transaction, I want you to understand that this is purely family fund not money laundering affair.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I solicit for your honest assistance as I want this fund to be transferred to your account in oversea with your partnership, I will want to invest this fund in your country.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can invest the fund as a family investment together with you in your country be assured that all the necessary document backing this fund has been arranged with one of the Attorney I meet here in Johannesburg South Africa, feel free to ask any question regarding this transaction.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hoping to hear from you soonest, kindly contact me through this my private email For Confidential: bohdana.aleksander @ yandex.com&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I need your urgent and confidential response towards this transaction.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks you and regards&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MRS BOHDANA ALEKSANDER&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all I would like to say, what happened with Mrs Bohdana Aleksander is definitely disheartening. I&#x27;m glad that I can be helpful for her in this terrifying situation. In my last post I said that I scream in void on my website but it turns out that even people from &#x27;chamber of commerce&#x27; read my blogs(Thanks Mrs Bohdana for making me aware of this fact). Big people read my blog and they entrust me to do big things for them. However, Mrs Bohdana forgot to mention the name of the country whose &#x27;chamber of commerce&#x27; reads my blog. well its somewhat understandable as she is going through so much hardship. Probably this is the same reason why she made some mistakes while writing English.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now coming back to the question of this opportunity. Should I take this or not. Should I act mean and not even reply or should I actually help a lone women and get rich as a result of it. Should I hide like a coward when opportunity calls or should I be the change I want to see in the world. I remember, a similar situation was once faced by Michael Scott. His quote might help me to take rightful decision:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;When the son of the deposed King of Nigeria e-mails you directly asking for help, you help. His father ran the freaking country, okay?&amp;quot;&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think missing this opportunity can be a life long regret. If I don&#x27;t help her someone else is gonna help her. I can only imagine what crazy things I can do with that crazy money. Maybe I&#x27;ll pay for Winrar or interfere with elections in some African democracy.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#x2F;pix&#x2F;nigerianprince.jpg&gt;&lt;img class=resmid src=&quot;&#x2F;pix&#x2F;nigerianprince.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;nigerian prince&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <title>Save Politics From Extreme Personalities</title>

          <guid>https://arjunyadav.xyz/blog/save-politics-from-extreme-personalities/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;How often it happens that we end up consuming information which is of no use to us. This happens to me more often than not when I read news. You might also have consumed this irrelevant info by now: A &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.aljazeera.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;2022&#x2F;8&#x2F;18&#x2F;finnish-pm-facing-backlash-over-leaked-party-footage&quot;&gt;video&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; of Finland&#x27;s Prime Minister Sanna Marin got viral where, as per many people, she is participating in a taboo where she is doing evil things like dancing, smiling, enjoying with her friends in a private environment! Such a normal thing to do yet there are people who are criticizing her. It seems like because of technology, especially in free countries, politicians are almost deprived of any private life. I like Yuval Noah Harari&#x27;s take on this that Politicians should have the right to be dumb private life. Sometimes saying something stupid or doing something stupid is what makes us human. Why deprive a politician of private life? Why deprive him from doing or saying something offensive&#x2F;stupid behind the doors? Me being an average person lot of funny&#x2F;dumb things come to my mind which if I put them on internet may offend some people. So in order to protect myself from the discomfort involved in sharing those thoughts with unknown audience I share them with my friends instead. Just realized that I actually have the privilege to write offensive things on my website and still get away with it as I basically scream in void here. But politicians do not have this privilege. Just imagine for a moment that you are a politician relaxing on your sofa and suddenly your daughter comes with her camera on, a completely normal phenomenon, and she asks &amp;quot;Dad why aren&#x27;t you on twitch?&amp;quot; you being a boomer: &amp;quot;I&#x27;m not on twitch because it carters degenerates.&amp;quot; Your daughter finds this opinion funny and shares this video with her only one friend who might find it funny too and she is pretty sure that that friend is definitely not going to share that video with anyone else! And boom within hours you find yourself being trending on twitter getting slaughtered by twitch streamers and their simps. You will find yourself being framed as a fascist dictator by opposition and they will demand your resignation! All this will happen just because a completely legal private moment of a politician got leaked in public. It goes without saying that a politician with enough intelligence would never say &amp;quot;Twitch is a pool of degenerates&amp;quot; in a public interview or something. Now you tell me, why care about the obscure opinions of politicians as long as those opinions don&#x27;t manifests themselves in country policy. Does it even matter if a politician privately thinks that Twitch is for degenerates as long as he doesn&#x27;t go and ban the website? I believe it does not. As people continue to get obsessed with politics, private life of politicians will continue to reduce. This elimination of private life, the elimination of the right to act dumb privately has and will continue to cause a specific problem. Politics as a result of elimination of private life will only attract some specific personalities to participate in it. Normal human just can&#x27;t handle this lifestyle where he is watched 24&#x2F;7. When a politician know people are going to watch him, he acts in a different way than what he would in private. A politician has to think before he speaks. Which is not a normal human thing to do if continued for longer period. I don&#x27;t usually think that deep when I&#x27;m talking with my friends, however speaking or acting in public is a completely different thing. How long can one act as if millions of people are watching him? How long can one prevent himself from saying&#x2F;doing normal human things? The elimination of private life results into creation of mainly two types of extreme personalities in politics. One: Mainly in free world we see more and more people becoming like Donald Trump. The people with the ability to act 24&#x2F;7. There is no concept of personal life in politicians with Donald Trump personality. They will say dumb things even if millions of people are watching. Second type of personality will be in the likes of Putin, mainly in states where totalitarian tendencies can be seen. Where politicians with personality like Putin is involved no one is allowed to record him in private life. And the only limited public appearances which exist are scripted and well acted performance. Now looking back to Finnish Prime Minister Sanna Marin we can see that how important it is for Finnish people to not to be rude with her. Good thing is that there are many women who are sharing their own dancing &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.msn.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;news&#x2F;world&#x2F;women-are-posting-their-own-dancing-videos-in-support-of-finnish-prime-minister-sanna-marin&#x2F;ar-AA10WJkp&quot;&gt;videos&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; in her support to show that dancing doesn&#x27;t make a woman witch. Like there is no need to criticize a politician for his personal life, there is no need to support him either. That what a politician do in his private life shall not be of anyone&#x27;s business unless its a criminal act or something which manifest itself as formation of government policy. Otherwise only extreme personalities will participate in politics.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#x2F;pix&#x2F;sannamarin.jpg&gt;&lt;img class=resmid src=&quot;&#x2F;pix&#x2F;sannamarin.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;sanna marnin&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <title>Book Review: Crime And Punishment</title>
          <pubDate>Thu, 04 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
          <author>Unknown</author>
          <link>https://arjunyadav.xyz/blog/bookreview-crimeandpunishment/</link>
          <guid>https://arjunyadav.xyz/blog/bookreview-crimeandpunishment/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently I finished reading &#x27;Crime And Punishment&#x27; by Fyodor Dostoevsky. I don&#x27;t usually like to read fiction as I find it to be just a waste of time. (Although this thinking seems to be changing as I continue to read more) After reading this book I realized the reason why people tend to put Dostoevsky  on such a high regard. So, following is my review of the book:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#x27;Crime And Punishment&#x27; is like a dish where if you remove or add one ingredient (character) the whole dish will become messed up. Even after having less experience of reading fiction I did not find it difficult to follow up with the characters. The book starts with questions and confusion. In first chapter, things are happening but reader might find it difficult to know exactly what.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main character Raskolnikov, a dropped out law college student, is well explained however Dostoevsky doesn&#x27;t show all of the Raskolnikov&#x27;s conditions right off the bat. You understand him as the story proceeds. And that&#x27;s the whole point of crime and punishment: To see how poor and desperate conditions can lead to making of a criminal and what happens psychologically to the victim of those conditions.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Razumikhin: friend and classmate of Raskolnikov is my favourite character. He is the life of this otherwise dead (as in depressed ) novel. He too is college dropped out but unlike Raskolnikov he is high on life. Razumikhin is a perfect friend! Without Razumikhin I don&#x27;t think I would even have finished this book.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall reading this book was like listening to a great classical music: There were different kinds of emotion flowing around but it did not lose its overall theme.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#x27;Crime And Punishment&#x27; is one of those rare books like &#x27;Animal Farm&#x27; by George Orwell where the author wants to give message but does not ruin the story in order to give message. Its a well written story! one can enjoy it even without digging deep into its philosophical message.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#x2F;pix&#x2F;Razumikhin.webp&gt;&lt;img class=resmid src=&quot;&#x2F;pix&#x2F;Razumikhin.webp&quot; alt=&quot;Razumikhin&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <title>Babur Ba&#x27;aish Kush Ki</title>
          <pubDate>Sat, 18 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

          <guid>https://arjunyadav.xyz/blog/babur/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome reader. Today I want to share with you one shair.(poem) written by  Babur: The man who built Mughal empire in India. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be with me, You might find it an interesting.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, before I write the shair out of blue It might be a good idea to know little bit of Babur&#x27;s back story. Babur was no ordinary sperm. He was a descendant of Timur and Genghis Khan. To rule was in his blood. But life was not always beautiful for him. After many losses he was left with poverty and an army of only forty men. And even those forty weren&#x27;t able to march with him all the time because of poverty. However he didn&#x27;t quit, continued fighting, started winning battles, he started to have obsession to rule India, Babur fought and won the battle of panipat. After all the years of suffering he concurred Delhi.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life became easy, now Babur had all the riches and he was surprised by the natural beauty of India that he wrote a shair on his condition:
&lt;img class=resright src=&quot;&#x2F;pix&#x2F;babur.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;250&quot; height=&quot;400&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;img&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Nauroz va naubahar va ma’i&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Va dilbari khusht&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Babur ba”aish kush ki&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alam dobara na ast&amp;quot;&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;( &lt;em&gt;the new year, the spring&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The wine and the beloved are pleasing&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;O Babur enjoy them&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;For the world is not to be had a second time&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;)&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <title>MX Linux is a really good distro</title>
          <pubDate>Tue, 14 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

          <description>&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;m currently daily driving MX Linux. In Debian side of the world, in my experience, I have found MX Linux to be a fair alternative to Ubuntu. It is actually a really good distro, and I have some points to back my statement:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1- According to MX Linux&#x27;s developers it&#x27;s a user-oriented distribution. Which means it includes some non-free software in it by default in order to make this distro &#x27;work out of the box&#x27; without giving the user much trouble. These non-free software may include fonts, media codecs, browsers etc. for example, in &#x27;MX package package installer&#x27; user has the ability to download google-chrome&#x2F;edge etc.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2- If you have only used Fedora and opensuse your entire life, you would find the installation time of MX Linux to be magical. I have found the MX Installer to be 3 times faster than Ubuntu&#x27;s installer. MX use its custom installer which has enough options and is fast at the same time.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3- If you are one of those people who don&#x27;t like the idea of systemd then you would feel at home to find that MX comes with there own init system by default. Which is, of course faster than systemd.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4- If you are one of those people who LIKE the idea of systemd then you would feel at home to find that MX linux has a systemd option which you can enable from MX Boot options or from the boot screen. It shows that MX is not just another &#x27;I hate systemd distro&#x27;, It is a user-oriented distro, if a user wants to run some applications which are only available under systemd then user has the ability to switch over to systemd without going full hacker mode. Apart from that I&#x27;ve found systemd on mX to work faster than on most distros. Boot time difference between Ubuntu and MX (systemd) is big.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5- Now comes MX tools. MX tools is like Yast on Debian. I like to do things on command line but after using MX tools I&#x27;ve found that sometimes GUI things can also save lot of time. For example, to block advertisement URLs I can manually go to github, copy all the URLs and add them to my host file. But hey, I can achieve the same with MX ad blocker tool with just few clicks! ad block is just one of them, with MX tools you can take system snapshot and can create your custom iso, can fix your boot problems, clean your system by deleting junk files, edit your bash config, install codes and even you can install Nvidia drivers!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6- You won&#x27;t be told to RTFM everytime you ask for help on MX forum. Even the developers will come out to solve your problem as soon as possible. Now some Arch users may not like the idea of the outright help but see not everybody has time and willingness to RTFM everytime something breaks in their system. of-course you learn things by RTFM but if you work 12 hour shift 6 days a week then I don&#x27;t think that reading the manual makes much sense.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7- MX Linus is a light weight distro. IT comes with xfce and kde, both are light on resources plus the boot time on MX are fast. It has for certainly given life to my crapy hardware. Even on their website it is said that MX was designed while keeping the old hardware in mind. And despite being lightweight MX comes with tons customization of options, even more than what you can find on some of the resource hog distros. On old or weak hardware MX is a must try.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These were some of the points why I consider MX Linux to be a really good disro. If you haven&#x27;t then do give MX a try, don&#x27;t just get off by the initial looks it&#x27;s highly customizable.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This post was proudly written on vim running on MX Linux.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <title>You hate NFTs? so cute</title>

          <guid>https://arjunyadav.xyz/blog/you-hate-nft-so-cute/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;We make fun of NFTs. And the people who buy NFTs are considered merely to be memes by the majority of us at this point. however, looking at NFTs from the business perspective does make lot of sense. NFTs are profitable, that is why many companies who have sold only physical goods from the dawn of their time are now doing heavy investment in selling virtual goods. Some of the luxury brands who are expanding their business to metaverse include Balenciaga, Gucci and Nike (Is Nike luxury? yes come visit the third world)&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;virtual-commodities-are-profitable&quot;&gt;Virtual commodities are profitable&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a fun fact: Some consumers are willing to pay much more for a virtual commodity than the same physical counterpart. Expensive game skins...people buy them. Even some ugly looking NFTs are being sold for millions! matter of the fact is people are willing to pay higher prices for virtual commodities, and it attracts investment from companies.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After price, lets see the cost of producing virtual commodities. The cost of producing a game skin or some NFT of monkey&#x27;s picture is far less than producing a physical commodity. Now show me one business which doesn&#x27;t like to reduce its cost of producing goods.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of cost, there is a big cost which takes a big chunk of profit from our poor multimillionaire companies i.e cost of keeping the inventory. In order to store physical commodity business must build warehouse, hire people, spend money and time on security etc. now how much money do you have spend to store virtual goods? compared to physical goods? NUFFIN!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, Price of virtual commodities is high, cost is low and profit is insane. Virtual commodity is sugar, business is ant, and the profit is sweetness.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;you-don-t-like-virtual-commodities-nfts-so-cute&quot;&gt;You don&#x27;t like virtual commodities&#x2F;NFTs? so cute.&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now we(majority) make fun of buying virtual commodities&#x2F;NFTs but you know what....businesses don&#x27;t care about us.(majority) They don&#x27;t care about your dislike of NFTs. They care about the people who buy them. See this if there are 1000 men on internet. (there are no real girls on internet only Russian bots) Out of these 1000 men, 950 hate buying virtual goods and only 50 men like to buy them. The thing to take in consideration here is that these 50 men (minority) are the molders of the internet not the 950 men (majority).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we know in market we vote by our money. In the example above we see that minority votes for the future of internet. Majority which hates to buy virtual goods does not vote. They don&#x27;t have the voter id card. They don&#x27;t participate in decision making.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Considering the amount of profit in selling virtual goods. Companies will shape the internet in such a way to facilitate the market for virtual goods&#x2F; NFTs. Internet is no more just a market place, its an whole economy.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are domain names virtual goods? Oh my....I became the same thing i swore to destroy.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <title>Buy Now Pay Later</title>
          <pubDate>Mon, 20 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
          <author>Unknown</author>
          <link>https://arjunyadav.xyz/blog/buy-now-pay-later/</link>
          <guid>https://arjunyadav.xyz/blog/buy-now-pay-later/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Lately I&#x27;ve been getting lot of calls from my bank telling me to get a free credit card. Not only my bank but also the banks in which i don&#x27;t even have account are also offering me free credit card. And not only banks but also some new fancy companies have approached me for interest free virtual credit card.  For a moment i thought my country is turning into some welfare state where they are lending money to poor people for free. It happens often times in free market economy that the marketing department pitch the deal in such a way that it sounds like the company is literally giving stuff for free. They make it sound like the company doesn&#x27;t exist for profit motive but solely for social welfare.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially i didn&#x27;t thought much about it, but few days ago, i watched a BBC documentary on free credit providers. It turns out that the reason these companies don&#x27;t charge interest from the consumers is that the people who buy goods on credit are not the costumers of these credit companies but they are the product. The real costumers are the sellers. (Amazon etc.) So basically what these credit companies do is that they go to sellers (Amazon etc.) and pitch them something like this : &amp;quot;Hey ecommerce website, see this x research which is conducted by y university, it shows that when sellers provide interest free credit to their costumers, it increases their sales by 20%. We can help you in increasing your sales. we will provide interest free credit to your costumers and for that you only have to pay us 5% on every sale made through our credit service.&amp;quot;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ecommerce platform: &amp;quot;Nice!&amp;quot;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems to be a win win situation for everyone at first sight. Consumers are happy that they are getting credit without interest, Sellers are happy that their sales are increasing, credit companies are happy that they are getting money from retailers.(or ecommerce platforms) umm...but, aren&#x27;t we missing something?....two things, we are missing two things. If we miss these two things we fail to see the suffering which is hiding in the plain sight.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;1-who-is-going-to-pay-for-increased-cost&quot;&gt;1) Who is going to pay for increased cost?&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes free credit service increases the sales numbers. But what&#x27;s the point of higher sales when new cost are also increased? In this case, To increase their sales the retailers (or ecommerce platforms) have to pay certain percentage of price to the credit companies. Technically, in this case these ecommerce platforms are paying the interest charges to credit companies on the behalf of its costumers. Now here you don&#x27;t have to be a professional economist to see that in long run, due to heavy competition profit margin will be reduced to the minimum (average profit) and if ecommerce platforms continue to bear interest charges on the behalf of its consumers they will go out of business. So eventually, to protect themselves from losses the ecommerce platforms will increase the price of their products.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A time will come when the cost of interest (or the commission which retailers have to pay to credit companies) will be seen as a natural cost of producing the product and will be added to the price of every product. People will think that they are getting free credit but little would they know that the interest charges are already added to the price of product.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;2-who-would-suffer-the-most&quot;&gt;2) Who would suffer the most?&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The people who don&#x27;t like to be in-debt. The people who think that debt is evil, will suffer the most. How? As we already saw that the cost of interest will eventually be added to the general prices of the commodities. Hence the people who won&#x27;t buy on debt will still be paying for the interest cost. Not all people will buy on credit but certainly the cost of interest will be distributed equally to every consumer irrespective of their payment method.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;who-will-win&quot;&gt;Who will win?&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lets imagine if there are 100 consumers in future, 60 of them buy goods on interest free credit, 40 (boomers) buy with cash. And the ecommerce platform is paying $1000 as commission to interest free credit providers &amp;gt; ecommerce platform adds this cost in the price of product &amp;gt; the new cost is distributed equally to each consumer &amp;gt; people who buy things on cash will also be paying for interest cost &amp;gt; as a result people who buy things on credit will be paying less than the actual interest charges they would have been paying otherwise.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The people who buy things on credit will be the only winners in the long run. Ecommerce platforms and credit providers will only earn average revenue (no profit no loss). And people who refuse to buy things on credit will be the real losers.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <title>Living In The Simulation Paradise</title>
          <pubDate>Wed, 15 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

          <link>https://arjunyadav.xyz/blog/living-in-the-simulation-paradise/</link>
          <guid>https://arjunyadav.xyz/blog/living-in-the-simulation-paradise/</guid>
          <description>&lt;html lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if we are living in a simulation. What if we all are just some characters in a video game, In which all the decisions which we think that we make (Deciding to drink water or choosing partner) are actually not made by us but by the person who is playing the video game. or maybe the simulation code from which our universe is made makes all the decisions. What if all the laws of nature are just the laws of a simulation code. 
&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is my favourite conspiracy theory. Even &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=xBKRuI2zHp0&quot;  target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Elon Musk&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=pmcrG7ZZKUc&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt; Neil deGrasse Tyson&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; believe that we might be living in a computer program. and you might also have some belief in this too. but unfortunately for us being just some video game characters it is impossible for us to know that if we are living in a simulated reality or not. This world is our reality, This code is our world. With our senses we can only experience this code.
&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The person who created this world, for the sake of this argument, lets call him God. And the problem with god is that we have not seen him. And god is the only being who knows whether our world simulated or not. When we have never met god how can we ask him this question?
&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only solution left to us is matrix. We must enquire that can we make a simulated reality in which a person&#x27;s body can still be in Delhi but his mind will be transferred to some other reality? If that can be done, we can conclude that if we can create a simulated reality then why can&#x27;t god too. and this will increase the chances of us living in a simulated reality from zero. One good thing here is that we have already reached a time where different realities are already being created. While consuming these simulated realities man only exists physically in this world but his mind is in different reality.
&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Before we go further let us just understand what we mean by reality here:
&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To experience our world we use our senses. what we See, Touch, Smell, Taste constitutes our reality. For example, Bulls can&#x27;t see the colour red, hence in their reality red doesn&#x27;t exist. Only the colours a Bull can see are real for him. At this moment lets divide reality into two parts first, Real Real (real truth) and second Perceived Real (what we think is real) 
&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first real, Real Real (real truth) doesn&#x27;t care if we know about it or not. It exist outside us and is independent form us. from example Black Holes in space still existed in space even when we didn&#x27;t know anything about them and they still continue to exist even after humans got to know that they exist.
&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second real, Perceived Real, is inside us and totally dependent on our senses. For us red colour exist is our Perceived Real but for Bull red colour doesn&#x27;t exist as he can&#x27;t see it that&#x27;s why the colour Red doesn&#x27;t constitute his Perceived Real. Perceived Real is much more stronger for us than Real Real (real truth) as it is only through our Perceived Real that we make our decisions. What if god exist and he is standing right next to you but like Bull who is colour blind, you are god blind and can&#x27;t see god. If it weren&#x27;t for our god blindness, this thousands of years old debate on existence of god wouldn&#x27;t have existed. (Sadiyon se yeh behas chalti rahi, par bhagwaan ki baat jahan thi wahi atki rahi!)
&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If our senses can be fooled, our perceived truth can be fooled. By fooling our senses a simulated world can be created where a person will loose all its touch form Real Real (the real truth) and enter into an  illusionary simulation. And for a person who&#x27;s living in illusionary simulation, real truth doesn&#x27;t matter anymore. for him illusionary simulation is new real. lets see how with current technology we are creating bits of illusionary perceived real. step by step we will see how every single one of senses can be fooled. and finally we will see how a time will come when we will completely loose our touch with current reality and will enter in a simulated one.
&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Fooling our senses with technology:
&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Eyes:&lt;&#x2F;b&gt; TV screens are good examples of creating small simulations&#x2F;matrix. Pictures shown on TV screens are like phantoms i.e half present half absent. What i mean by that is the characters in movies and TV serials are fictional however they still have impact on real lives. For example Indian women knew that their favourite character in &#x27;Saas Bahu&#x27; serial is fictional but still these women cried when their favourite character slept hungry. And why only these women we all must have cried sometime watching an emotional scene. We cry even though we know its fake. We know its fake but we still don&#x27;t know its fake. Its like our brain can&#x27;t distinguish between women sleeping hungry on a screen and a women sleeping hungry in front of your house. And why shouldn&#x27;t our brain believe whatever it sees in TV screen? for millions of years our brain has gone through evolution to see reality through eyes. TV screens are new, it won&#x27;t be that easy for our brains to distinguish between the picture shown on TV screen and life outside it. For our brain both are reality.
&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ear:&lt;&#x2F;b&gt; Music! similar to TV screens, our brains can&#x27;t distinguish between what it listens on earphone from what it listen from its real surroundings. Even a weak man can feel powerful by listening to &#x27;Dance of the nights&#x27;. will write more on EVIL effects of music on us in next article.
&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Skin:&lt;&#x2F;b&gt; Yes, by using devices which give &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=uPnHzQ7qJ2Y&quot;  target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Haptic feedback.&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; one can get the feeling of simulated touch. Another example can be seen in pilot training, in order to reduce the cost involved in setting up a full size cockpit mockup, a device which gives haptic feedback is used to &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wired.com&#x2F;story&#x2F;pilot-training-simulator-vr-haptic-touch&#x2F;&quot;  target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;train pilots.&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href=..&#x2F;pix&#x2F;290921&#x2F;haptics.jpeg&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;..&#x2F;pix&#x2F;290921&#x2F;haptics.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Haptics Feedback&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;center&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Smell:&lt;&#x2F;b&gt; Yes electronically generated fake smell does &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;GLvqk8Hmcqs&quot;  target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt; exist.&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Taste:&lt;&#x2F;b&gt; Yes, electronically generated taste does &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=sSJ63KXyMqU&quot;  target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;exist&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; to fool your body in believing that one is really eating something. With this device you just have to stick your tongue with a plugged in circuit board and that&#x27;s it you can now taste electronically generated Sweetness, Sourness or Bitterness.
&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Creating matrix paradise with VR sets
&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href=&#x2F;pix&#x2F;290921&#x2F;senpai.jpeg&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; src=&quot;&#x2F;pix&#x2F;290921&#x2F;senpai.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;senpai&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previously we saw how TV creates matrix by fooling our Eyes and how music fools our Ears and so on. But their limitation is that they are only able to form a partial matrix as they only exploit one or two senses. They are not able to form complete matrix where a person can loose his complete touch with reality. A successful matrix can only be the one where a person looses his complete touch with reality and enter into simulation. In a full matrix, simulation must become a complete Perceived Real. Here I&#x27;m optimistic with VR technology. It combines all the small matrix (screen, sound etc.) to create a &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;img-9gag-fun.9cache.com&#x2F;photo&#x2F;aGpm930_460svav1.mp4&quot;  target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;full matrix.&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; See &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=eS43PEn7lEE&quot;  target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;this&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; funny example from the Onion, here except smell (and taste. but do you need taste for that?) the person enters into a matrix. &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=LH8bMx66bfY&quot;  target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;these&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; are some other funny examples which shows how one looses touch with reality and enter into matrix by using VR. Even after its success i believe it will at least two decades for VR technology to create a real matrix. and a time will come where we humans will spend most of our lives living in a full matrix, something similar to the Matrix movie.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href=&#x2F;pix&#x2F;290921&#x2F;zuck.jpg&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; src=&quot;&#x2F;pix&#x2F;290921&#x2F;zuck.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;zuck matrix&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;

          <title>Ban In India</title>
          <pubDate>Tue, 07 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
          <author>Unknown</author>
          <link>https://arjunyadav.xyz/blog/ban-in-india/</link>
          <guid>https://arjunyadav.xyz/blog/ban-in-india/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;To protect the easily exploitable consumers our Govt. banned Tiktok. Now it seems to be the turn of cryptocurrencies. Arguments are being made by people in defence of crypto currency ban. But as things are not yet quite clear in the bill. We are left with speculations and arguments. Just banning cryptocurrency doesn&#x27;t seems to be a viable solution.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One argument is that there are just too many cryptocurrencies, but in order to become money (As a medium of exchange) uniformity is a necessity. Yes, this is true however in long run this argument is irrelevant because we know, Monopoly is the end of competition. Mr. Raghuram Rajan said &amp;quot;Out of 6000 odd cryptocurrencies only one or two best will survive.&amp;quot; Here we can learn from history that even in barter system, initially, there was lot of competition but in long run gold and silver came out as clear winners. we won&#x27;t be wrong predicting the same for cryptocurrencies.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another argument made is that the average investor in India is 24 years old, first time investor who is being lured by false higher rewards shown in the advertisements of crypto trading companies. As a natural consequence of this, Indian investors loose money, the lost money then goes out of India and reduces our currency reserves. Well, we all know at least one person who falls under this category. Unfortunately, there are (lot of) people in India who are an easy prey for crypto currency propaganda.(Advertisement) This is a chief argument made for crypto ban. But if we move our heads a bit we can see a similar phenomenon happening. The same 24 year old ignorant guy who is putting his money in cryptocurrency without understanding how it works is also investing in stock market without being able to even read a balance sheet. If cryptocurrency is being banned because average Indian investor is ignorant and easily exploitable then by this logic stock market should also be banned. Here i guess ban is not a viable solution to protect the ignorant and easily exploitable masses but our government must take stand to educate our investors so that they are able to make rational decisions. As the saying goes &amp;quot;Dear God don&#x27;t give us easy circumstances but make us strong enough so that we can conquer even the tough ones.&amp;quot;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;argument that banning foreign crypto giants will help our Indian home grown cryptos. Yes, it will help our &#x27;Made in India&#x27; cryptos, but for how long? lets imagine its 2040 and we have been successful at keeping foreign cryptocurrencies at bay. As we already know by that time there will be only one or two cryptocurrencies which will have a substantial global share in being used as a medium of exchange. At that point India will encounter two major problems: first, Indians won&#x27;t be able make international payments as in 2040 Indians won&#x27;t have reserves of the internationally standardized cryptocurrencies because they are banned in India. Secondly, if India at that point decides to open its markets for foreign cryptocurrencies, it will most probably disrupt the then established crypto market. If markets are opened in 2040 Indians may give higher preference to the currencies which are by then were able to establish themselves as international standard. As a result Indian crypto companies will suffer the most. In this way the time taken to open boarders for cryptocurrencies will be directly proportional to its consequences on Indians and Indian crypto currencies.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now comes the argument that because of the secure nature of cryptocurrencies it may be used by terrorists. As lot has already been said by others to counter this argument, i will try to protect myself from repeating them. But i would still say that evil or good nature of any technology strictly depends on the hands who use them. A knife can be used to cut an apple or cut a throat. Then ban knife too? If we ban all the technology which can be used by evil hands then wouldn&#x27;t India go back to stone age? (Even stones can also be used to harm others, ban them too?)&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our respected experts at RBI have done their research and they have come up with a plan to regulate the cryptocurrency market. But until we see this bill in execution we won&#x27;t be able to see its real implications. Most of the arguments which are given seems to be unprepared excuses which hides the fact that the predominant reason for the ban is to keep in control the supply of medium of exchange in the country. Least we can do is to hope for the regulations to be liberal enough to prevent the unnecessary losses.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <title>Future Zucks Bro</title>

          <description>&lt;p&gt;Everyone on internet has been talking about Meta and Metaverse since its idea was proposed by Zuckerberg. I think the general opinion of people on internet can be summerised this way: &amp;quot;The idea of metaverse looks like something from black mirror. Everyone knows its bad hence its just another bad decision made by Facebook.&amp;quot;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do agree with the first part that the idea of Meta does look like something from black mirror and is depressing. however, as far as second part is concerned, i think, Facebook actually made a right decision. At this point metaverse IS inevitable And most of the people who are criticizing Facebook WILL be in metaverse.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;why-metaverse-is-inevitable&quot;&gt;Why Metaverse is Inevitable&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember reading an essay where the author claimed that when a species becomes more advanced it tends to focus its attention on finding shortcuts. What kind of shortcuts? We humans have reached a stage where we focus much of our attention on achieving things virtually rather than in real life. Why virtually? Because its easier. I quote : &amp;quot;Technology is fairly good at controlling external external reality to promote real biological fitness, but its even better at delivering fake fitness - subjective cues of survival and reproduction without real-world effects&amp;quot; further he says &amp;quot;...I think that aliens forget to send radio signals or colonise space because they&#x27;re too busy with runaway consumerism and virtual reality narcissism. Once they turn inwards to chase their shiny pennies of pleasure, they loose the cosmic plot&amp;quot;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the reason why i think metaverse is inevitable. Metaverse is the next step of the &#x27;shortcuts&#x27; we create to make our lives easier. Want to go to Switzerland but you are an average wage earner from a third world country? No problem! just buy this affordable meta VR set, download&#x2F;stream this Switzerland program and within minutes you are in Switzerland. (virtually) Isn&#x27;t it a good shortcut? Traditionally, you would have to earn a lot of money to travel in Switzerland but now (lets say 2027) you can get it cheaply without leaving your parent&#x27;s basement!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now for us internet is not new. We know enough history of internet that we can see patterns to predict future. I agree with Zuck when he said &amp;quot;Our (consumer&#x27;s) internet consumption has moved from &#x27;text&#x27; in its early stages to pictures to now videos (Tiktok, Insta-stories...) and future&#x27;s consumer demands a metaverse&amp;quot; Metaverse is inevitable if Facebook doesn&#x27;t do it someone else will. Internet is fast and it is getting faster day by day, companies like facebook are investing lots of money into making equipment for metaverse, people want to engage more with VR. In other words consumers are willing to buy metaverse, companies are willing to sell metaverse and infrastructure is willing to support metaverse. Hence it is inevitable.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;going-back-to-2004&quot;&gt;Going Back to 2004&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What would have happened if Zuckerberg in 2004 had made a similar announcement for Facebook what he made for meta?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zuckerberg: &amp;quot;umm..Yeah so..we got internet but we&#x27;re still kinda unconnected so I&#x27;m gonna launch Facebook a social media website by which people would be able to connect with each other, share their birthday pictures with friends, can send messages, if you are a seller you can sell products. Basically the possibilities are limitless&amp;quot;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People: &amp;quot;OMG! its so frightening! we would be able to send each other messages but you know what this dude will own the platform so his company would be able to read those messages. And no I&#x27;m never gonna share my private birthday memories with people on internet. What do you mean by sellers can sell their products on internet? they would be able to target advertising and sell me the things that i don&#x27;t want to buy! No this idea is clearly stupid no one is ever gonna use your authoritative platform. No one will!&amp;quot;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what actually happened? in 2021 there are approx 2.8 billion Facebook users. If Facebook is bad than no one should use it right?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;democrazy&quot;&gt;Democrazy&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its a well known fact that Facebook (company) is a privacy nightmare but still its users are constantly increasing. Generally it seems like convenience overpowers common sense. Few idiots who get pissed off by the privacy policies of these social media platforms make their own websites to share their based articles. (Bascially these pople focus their attention on finding alternatives) VERY few saints leave internet altogether. However, free market is like democracy which is ruled by majority not by minority. Majority on internet needs convenience, hence ignorant convenience rules the internet. Metaverse seems to be a really convenient thing. Despite the consequences of metaverse i think, people will still vote (use) for its rule. Sure a minority of outlaws will always exist with their self hosted alternatives but they will never be able to become a member of Internet&#x27;s parliament.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;don-t-be-a-luke-smith&quot;&gt;Don&#x27;t be a Luke Smith&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luke Smith is the reason why i have my personal website. And I&#x27;m not alone, there are many people who are influenced by Luke. But one critique of Luke is that he seems to be in an irrelevant war against social media. He is focusing too much on finding alternatives. Do you really need a self hosted &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=oOiCACmjKBM&quot;&gt;twitter alternative&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;? Twitter is a disease. When you are suffering from a disease, you don&#x27;t find it&#x27;s alternatives you get rid of it altogether.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What Luke says: &amp;quot;Host Mestadon and free yourself from corporate owned twitter&amp;quot;
What i hear: &amp;quot;host your own cancer to free yourself from corporate owned cancer&amp;quot;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What i&#x27;m trying to say is when metaverse will become a normal thing maybe lets say in 2028, it would be better to not to host your own metaverse or find alternatives but to rather leave metaverse altogether.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luke Smith in 2028:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#x2F;pix&#x2F;luke2028.jpg&gt;&lt;img class=resmid src=&quot;&#x2F;pix&#x2F;luke2028.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;luke&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think Zuck made a right decision by focusing his companies focus on metverse. The reason he was able to make such an prediction for future is that now we know a thing or two about the history of internet and connecting dots leads nowhere but to metaverse. It seems metaverse industry is inevitable. And Zuck&#x27;s willingness to be an early bird in this industry might beneficial for Facebook (Meta) that&#x27;s why i think future Zucks bro!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <title>Cool trick to install software via apt package manager</title>
          <pubDate>Mon, 01 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

          <guid>https://arjunyadav.xyz/blog/cool-trick-to-install-software-via-apt-package-manager/</guid>
          <description>&lt;html lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
to install software via apt in debian and debian based distros you have to type &quot;sudo apt install foo&quot; however there are two problems with this:
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
1- you have to know the exact name of the package you want to install
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2- you have to type &amp;quot;sudo apt install foo&amp;quot; which is somewhat long.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
there is a cool trick which someone posted on reddit.(and i can&#x27;t remember the exact source at this moment)
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;paste this code in terminal:
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;code&gt; apt-cache search &amp;quot;&amp;quot; | sort | cut --delimiter &amp;quot; &amp;quot; --fields 1 | fzf --multi --cycle --reverse --preview &amp;quot;apt-cache show {1}&amp;quot; --preview-window=:57%:wrap:rounded:hidden --bind=space:toggle-preview | xargs -r sudo apt install -y &lt;&#x2F;code&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;a href=&#x2F;pix&#x2F;fapt.png&gt;&lt;img class=resmid src=&quot;&#x2F;pix&#x2F;fapt.png&quot; alt=&quot;fapt&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;br&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(ofcourse you can make a simple script or make alias of this big command to make it short) 
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
technically he just added apt repository with fuzzy finder, but no one had ever thought of doing this simple thing, and that&#x27;s why i&#x27;m thankful to the guy who originally posted this on reddit.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
prerequisite:
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
you should have fzf installed in order to use it.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;The Musical Revolution and its consequences have been a disaster for human race. Gone are the days of sophisticated lyrics and good voice. Junk lyrics with auto-tune voice is ruling the music market. This is the music revolution. You might find me ranting about these new age songs here but this is also true that there are way more people who intoxicate themselves with these type of junk songs as compared to the people who enjoy good old songs.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally we listen to music for its ability to give pleasure to our mind. As consuming music activates same part of brain similar to what is activated by eating food and taking &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.newsweek.com&#x2F;music-produces-pleasure-similarly-drugs-and-sex-553946&quot;&gt;drugs&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. Not only for pleasure we might also consume music to escape from reality or just for nostalgia. Listing to music for escape from reality is enough to make one restrain from indulging too much into music. Apart from that the quality of music we consume is also degrading. Lets see in coming paragraph how.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#x2F;pix&#x2F;doomermusic.jpg&gt;&lt;img class=resmid src=&quot;&#x2F;pix&#x2F;doomermusic.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;doomer&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;empty-calories-it-sounds-good-but-the-lyrics-are-meaningless&quot;&gt;Empty Calories (It sounds good but the lyrics are meaningless)&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember the song from your grandfather&#x27;s time &amp;quot;Rote hue aate hain sab hasta hua jo jayega wo...&amp;quot; or from your father&#x27;s time &amp;quot;duniya mane bura to goli maro, dar ke jeena bhi koi jeena yaaro?&amp;quot; and what do you have the young of 2021? &amp;quot;Diladu Ghar chandigarh mai...&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;coca cola tu, sona sona tu, coca cola tu, sona sona tu....&amp;quot; (For the ones from English speaking countries, remember the lyrics of The Gambler Song? and compare it with 6ix9ine&#x27;s &amp;quot;Niggas act dumb when i act dumb-dumb tell &#x27;em don&#x27;t act dumb coz I&#x27;m dumber&amp;quot;) Don&#x27;t you think over the years the quality of lyrics have reduced down to just being junk? Its quite normal these days, for a junk song to hit the trending list. But it was difficult, two decades ago for a junk song to achieve the same. The question is what is the difference now that junk songs are getting all the popularity? I think the reason lies in the MUSIC used in the songs. The music which is being used now a days in songs is much more stimulating than what it was 2 or 3 decades ago. Now with the help of technology artificial stimulative sounds can be created which are nonexistent in old songs which used real instruments to produce sounds. As a result of all this the songs now a days have become much more stimulating, because the focus is more on the music rather than lyrics the quality of lyrics has come down. And why not? People are listening songs for pleasure or escape and for these reasons they need more stimulating things which are being provided by the artificial music. This is similar to eating junk food.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like the junk food which tastes good but does not have anything healthy in it. The same way it is with modern music. The taste of Junk Food hides its emptiness. The taste alone hides its poor nutrition value. When eating Fast Food people forget about the nutrition value and only focus on its taste. If you ask an American to choose between a McDonald&#x27;s Burger and a Banana, he would probably choose the Burger even though it will have bad impact on his health. As a rule of thumb you can make people eat shit if you add enough spices in it. People will be happy to eat shit as long as it will taste good. And if for some reason you tell them that what they are eating is just a shit camouflaged by spices and cheese, people will boycott you.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the similar way it is with modern music. On the surface the new songs are much more stimulating and sounds good but deep down they are just a shit camouflaged by artificial stimulative music.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;lenin-on-music&quot;&gt;Lenin on Music&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes..yes..he killed 20 Gazillion people in Soviet Russia, so what? For a moment lets forget his political sins and see what he has to say on music. Maybe we will learn something from it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;But often I can’t listen to music. It acts on my nerves. It makes one want to
say a lot of sweet nonsense and stroke the heads of people who live in a
filthy hell-hole and yet can create such beauty. But you can’t stroke
anyone’s head today – you’ll get your hands cut off. The need is to beat
them over the head, beat them mercilessly even though we, as an ideal, are
against any coercion of people. Hm, hm ... it’s a hellishly difficult
necessity.&amp;quot;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#x2F;pix&#x2F;gulag.jpg&gt;&lt;img class=resmid src=&quot;&#x2F;pix&#x2F;gulag.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;gulag&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <title>Review of Various Linux Distros</title>
          <pubDate>Sun, 24 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
          <author>Unknown</author>
          <link>https://arjunyadav.xyz/blog/review-of-various-linux-distros/</link>
          <guid>https://arjunyadav.xyz/blog/review-of-various-linux-distros/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;If we go to Distrowatch we can find that there are hundreds of Linux distros listed there but at the end we can see that most of those Linux distros are more or less themed versions of three major Linux distributions i.e Arch, Debian and Fedora. Reviewing all of the distributions available on Distrowatch is not only time consuming but also irrelevant. Hence i will restrict myself with reviewing only the ones which i think are relevant.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;arch&quot;&gt;Arch&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arch is a rolling-release Distro which means whenever a new version of a package is released Arch users get it through instant updates. In Arch Linux, there are lot of updates, updates everywhere! Arch users are the first ones to get latest software in Linux world, but they are also the first ones to encounter the bugs. One thing which comes to the mind of many users when they start to use Arch is that they should&#x27;ve listened to the memes.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although in official repository, Arch has less packages availability than that of Debian. However to compensate that arch has its &#x27;Arch User Repository&#x27; (AUR) where the arch users submit the software compiled by them. Personally I&#x27;ve found that every proprietary software which is made to work on Linux is available in AUR. This is a big selling point of Arch Linux, you don&#x27;t have to go on different websites to download .deb and .rpm in order to install software on your machine. On Arch, for example if you want to install brave browser you just need to type &lt;code&gt;yay -S brave-bin&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; and that&#x27;s it Brave will be installed on your system. Contrary to that if you were using a Debian based distribution you would have to go through 3-4 step process to install brave!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;debian&quot;&gt;Debian&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Debian has three release models i.e Stable, Testing  and Unstable. However according to Debian&#x27;s website only stable is recommended for general use. Debian developers use Testing and Unstable as the testing ground for Stable. But still you can find many Debian Unstable users on internet who claim that their distro does not break. Debian has the highest number of packages in its repositories, more than double than that of Arch&#x27;s but you won&#x27;t be able to find those proprietary software in Debian&#x27;s repository which are available in AUR. When used on workstations Debian Stable is criticised for having obsolete packages. It is understandable for Debian after one year of its release to have older packages but even the new release lags behind 5 months of development. It has its own use case, on server you don&#x27;t usually want your disto to be a rolling-release, on servers debian comes to your help. But still there are lot of people who don&#x27;t care what version number they are using. These people use Debian stable as their daily driver and are happy with it. I consider myself of this category however my love with Debian is only one sided, Debian refuses to boot on my hardware even though i used iso with non-free drivers.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;fedora&quot;&gt;Fedora&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;m not sure about the release cycle of Fedora. It&#x27;s not a complete rolling-release nor its a stable release. Some parts of Fedora gets all kind of updates on the other hand some just get security fixes. Although a new version of fedora comes every six months.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;ve two major concerns about Fedora. First, it is usually the fist distro to adopt a new technology. Fedora was the first distro to use wayland. Now wayland has made the Linux experience much more smoother however when it first came, in its early stage, wayland was giving much problems. Too much ram usage, applications not supporting wayland were some of the many problems which were associated with wayland in its early stage and as Fedora was using wayland, all its users were suffering because of it. Wayland is only one example of many new technologies which were adopted by Fedora before anyone else did. As desktop users we must know that Fedora is a testing ground for red hat. Hence it is not the best thing to be used on personal computers.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, the package manager used by Fedora: DNF, it is slooooow! DNF automatically updates its repository everytime user wants to install a package. This sounds good on paper however the update of repository takes longer on fedora as compared to that of Debian. Which makes it troublesome to install or perform basic tasks with packages in Fedora terminal.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;ubuntu&quot;&gt;Ubuntu&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ubuntu is the windows of Linux world. It is the most hated one. But still i think in consumer market Ubuntu has played the biggest role in the success of Linux. Linux would have only being using by nerds in their parent&#x27;s basements if it was not for Ubuntu. On the surface you can say Ubuntu is based on Debian, but can you really recommend a new user to use Debian? That is the work done by Ubuntu devs to make &#x27;Linux for humans&#x27;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes there are some genuine concerns about ubuntu for example snaps etc. but hey, no one is forcing you to stick with ubuntu, now its no more 2010. Other distros have matured in providing a good consumer experience, just move to them if you don&#x27;t like snaps and the direction in which ubuntu is moving.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <title>Critique of Luke Smith&#x27;s Freedom</title>
          <pubDate>Fri, 20 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
          <author>Unknown</author>
          <link>https://arjunyadav.xyz/blog/critique-of-luke-smith-s-freedom/</link>
          <guid>https://arjunyadav.xyz/blog/critique-of-luke-smith-s-freedom/</guid>
          <description>&lt;html lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;p&gt;in his recent &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lukesmith.xyz&#x2F;articles&#x2F;modern-freedom-means-being-a-slave-to-impulses&quot;&gt;work&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; Luke smith, while explaining freedom, writes:&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&quot;Christians stated the classical view of freedom very clearly. Paul writes that all men are either &quot;slaves to Christ&quot; or &quot;slaves to sin.&quot; The modern man wants to retort that he does&#x27;t want to be a slave to anything, but wants to be his own master, but there is really no such thing.
&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One can be guided by Christ, or more generally, by consistent moral principles, restraint and forethought. Or one can abandon the pretense of morality and by definition follow his impulses to fornication, substance-abuse, and general reckless living. &quot;
&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it is clear from his work that, what Luke is trying to say here is: man is either first,a slave of god or second, a slave of impulses. and there is no middle ground i.e man is not free. man can&#x27;t think for himself. man needs a master to tell him what to do. 
&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;in first case, god tells man what good things man has to do to get emancipation from the evil.(the problem here is that there is not only one god in this world, but multiple. who have mostly contradictory rules of do&#x27;s and don&#x27;t&#x27;s) for example a Hindu will listen to his god and will not harm the weak, don&#x27;t act cowardly, perform his responsibilities and so on.
&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;in the second case, instead of listing to god. man becomes rebellious, denies the existence of god. and sets the belief of listing to himself. but according to Luke, man is slave to his impulses hence he only listens to his impulses. for example doing drugs, checking social media every 5 minutes, being watching movies and so on. the point here is that man thinks he is free but he is slave to his impulses.
&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;unfortunately Luke the unaboomer is wrong.
&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p class=sub&gt;man is not just impulses
&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i say Luke only finds fault in man only to give himself reason to do slavery of god. when Luke says man is slave to his impulses, he only sees the animal part of the man. man is more than just impulses. man is a conscious being. who can think. who can decide. who can act rationally. animal on the other hand are the real slaves of impulses. eat, sleep, reproduce is what all they think but man is different from them. man is an animal who can think. but according to Luke man is only an animal i.e a slave to impulses.
&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;as karl marx wrote:&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&quot;The animal is immediately one with its life activity. It does not distinguish itself from it. It is its life activity. Man makes his life activity itself the object of his will and of his consciousness. He has conscious life activity. It is not a determination with which he directly merges. Conscious life activity distinguishes man immediately from animal life activity. It is just because of this that he is a species-being. Or it is only because he is a species-being that he is a conscious being, i.e., that his own life is an object for him. Only because of that is his activity free activity.&quot;
&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;if man is just a slave to impulses then why not all people watch t.v. 10 hours a day? there are always some addict who do watch t.v. 10 hours a day but most of us don&#x27;t. because we can think. we can think it&#x27;s unhealthy and there are other responsibilities which are need to be fulfilled. but if we follow Luke&#x27;s idea and see man as just a slave of impulses everyone should be watching t.v. 10 hours a day. which is wrong.
&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p class=sub&gt;does religion gives all the answers?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;multiple religions with different philosophies. often contradictory. then how do you decide which one to follow? or which one is right? the debate on these questions are continuing from the dawn of the time but no one has found a compelling answer. 
&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;can Luke smith&#x27;s bible tell how much hours of internet consumption is good and how much is evil?
can Luke smith&#x27;s bible tell how much McDonald consumption is good and how much is evil?
&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;yes the exact answers to these questions can not be found in religious books. that&#x27;s where human thinking comes. man thinks how much consumption is good and how much is unhealthy.man does not need religion to answer these and other question. it&#x27;s common sense.
&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the why even bother doing slavery of god when man can take control of his impulses by just thinking?
&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;perhaps Luke smith answer this question by saying &quot;going to church is cool&quot; or &quot;all the cool kids are religious&quot; and so on. Luke smith is the kind of guy who would do slavery just to look cool on internet.
&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p class=sub&gt;the real solution to get freedom: take responsibility and be free
&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a kid is a slave to his parents. in the sense that he has to eat and do what his parents decide. because he is not mature enough to think for himself. but as he grows, he starts to think, makes decisions, and he is also held accountable for his actions. his parents gives him more freedom to decide what&#x27;s better for him. for example giving him the freedom to decide his course in college etc. and that kid gets complete freedom when he starts to earn money. now his parents no more tell him what to eat and what not to. if he in his adult age eat chocolate all the time it&#x27;s he who is responsible for his ill health. but now as he is adult and knows all the ill effects of eating too much chocolate he no more eats them. he is free to decide. but taking right decisions is his responsibility. if he can not take right decisions. his freedom must be taken back. doctors will force him to stick to healthy diet. the moment he fails to take responsibility he looses his freedom.
&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;hence taking responsibility is the only way to get freedom.
&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;when stuck in problem, take responsibility and find solution. and if the solution does&#x27;t work, take responsibility of your failure. only in this way freedom can be achieved.
&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;finally,
&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1- a man who is slave to his impulses is not a man but animal and should be called one.&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
2- being slave to god is better than being slave to impulses. but still not free yet.&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
3- thinking,making decisions, taking responsibility of your actions is true freedom. this is what distinguishes us from animals who are slave of impulses.   
&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <title>The Tiktok Want!</title>
          <pubDate>Mon, 09 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

          <guid>https://arjunyadav.xyz/blog/the-tiktok-want/</guid>
          <description>&lt;html lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it&#x27;s been almost a year since Indian government banned TikTok. what is interesting here is that tiktok was banned not only because of political reasons but also because of social reasons. people, especially the ones with power thought that tiktok is degenerating their youth. but these boomers forgot that it was the &#x27;social&#x27; who was responsible for the tiktok i.e it was the market which had a need for an app like tiktok. market needed an app which can provide easy to consume 15 seconds long videos which are full of stimulus and most importantly super easy to edit. tiktok fulfilled this need.&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;what has been the consequence of their decision? one year ago they banned one tiktok now there are over a dozen of tiktoks in the market. previously there was almost a monopoly of tiktok in this market. now different apps like moj, josh, mxtakatak etc.[1] are jumping like monkeys to get a bigger share of this newly vacated market. just look at the top charts of play store or app store, you can find plenty of these apps jumping there. before tiktok ban these apps didn&#x27;t even existed, or the ones which existed knew that they have lost this battle against tiktok. these apps, however with different names, are all the same. they are trying to satisfy the same want, the &#x27;tiktok want&#x27;: easy to consume 15 second long videos which are full of stimulus and most importantly super easy to edit.&lt;&#x2F;br&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;br&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;bigger players like youtube and facebook also know the significance of this newly generated &#x27;tiktok want&#x27;. so they created their own tiktoks- what do you think youtube shorts are? and what are facebook stories? or insagram stories? or maybe whatsapp status? and damn now even twitter has its stories! different name has been given to this evil need but goal is same i.e to satisfy the &#x27;tiktok want&#x27;: easy to consume 15 second long videos which are full of stimulus and most importantly super easy to edit.&lt;&#x2F;br&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;br&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;these new tiktok apps are laughing on the face of those old people who thought that banning tiktok would be the solution of those poor circumstances. little did our boomers knew that this &#x27;tiktok want&#x27; virus is soon going to take over their daily apps. now the boomers themselves are updating their whatsapp status which is edited by one of these tiktok apps. it turns out that tiktok is not just an app, it is a need (or a crude want) which is demanded by the market. tiktok can be banned from the market but the &#x27;tiktok want&#x27; can not be banned from the hearts of the people.&lt;&#x2F;br&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;when prostitution is the problem you don&#x27;t ban a single prostitute but the whole activity of prostitution. when &#x27;tiktok want&#x27; is the problem you don&#x27;t ban a single tiktok but have to ban the whole activity which is related with the satisfaction of &#x27;tiktok want&#x27;. which in current circumstances seems not to be possible.&lt;&#x2F;br&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;br&gt;
&lt;a href=&#x2F;pix&#x2F;tiktok.png&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&#x2F;pix&#x2F;tiktok.png&quot; alt=&quot;tiktok&quot; class=resmid&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a
&lt;p&gt;notes:&lt;&#x2F;br&gt;
[1] these apps have funny names but the times are depressing.&lt;&#x2F;br&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <title>Poisoning of The Mind</title>
          <pubDate>Mon, 05 Jul 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

          <description>&lt;html lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
from books being the hobby of only rich people to mass printing, and from village halls to internet, a lot has been changed. 100 years ago the means of getting information were so less that the question was &quot;how to get information&quot;. and now an average man is surrounded by so many equipments of getting information that now the question is not &quot;how to get information&quot; but &quot;what information to get&quot;.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it is easier now than ever to get one&#x27;s mind preoccupied by irrelevant ideas. ideas which have nothing to do with one&#x27;s real life situation. for example we can see people spending their valuable time on internet by defending irrelevant ideologies. these irrelevant ideologies are noting but parasites, they only flourish on internet and in the mind of internet users. what terrifying is that the person in whose mind these ideas live, forgets his real self and starts to identify himself with political ideologies. these parasite ideas are not only restricted to political ideologies they can also include choosing a group between religion vs atheism, this gender vs that gender, Linux vs windows groups etc. the point of these parasites is to occupy the mind of man. under the occupation of these parasites man goes farther and farther away from reality. and only sees the picture of the world through the filter of these parasites. 
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to further explain what i mean by &amp;quot;seeing the world from the filter of these parasites&amp;quot; lets see a recent &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pewresearch.org&#x2F;fact-tank&#x2F;2021&#x2F;06&#x2F;02&#x2F;americans-in-news-media-bubbles-think-differently-about-foreign-policy-than-others&#x2F;&quot;&gt;work&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; done by pew research, where pew research found how people who are stuck in media bubbles have irrational stands about different problems, viewers of both CNN and fox news bubble have irrational opinions. this research also shows how the people who are stuck in media bubbles loose their ability to think critically. this is the poisoning of mind. CNN and fox news both are like parasites which live in the mind of their viewers. their viewers forget that world exists beyond democrats and republicans. viewers forgets other aspects of life and only talk about politics all the time. the question is do the viewrs really need to feed that much propaganda to their brain? is this much dose of irrelevant politics is good for mental health?
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;more than a century ago, Arthur Schopenhauer, in his work &#x27;on books and reading&#x27;, wrote how a man poisons his mind by reading books of poor content i.e books of popular culture fiction, religious and political pamphlets etc. Arthur advices to learn the art of refraining from reading poor content of popular culture. he further claims that &amp;quot;the man who writes for fools is always sure of a large audience&amp;quot;. what one should do is to read great minds of all ages not all minds of current age. by this way, and only by this way one can prevent one&#x27;s mind from getting poisoning from poor content.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;back in the days people suffered because of less information now people are suffering from too much information. but if we compare two man, one from current times to the one from older times, the man from older times would be better off as at least his mind was not filled with the propaganda provided by different political groups and businesses.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
it is the skill of refraining which a man should learn now. thanks to technological advancements that there are way more things today which a man can read and watch which were unimaginable yesterday. the question shall not only be what to be read and watched but also what NOT to be read or watched.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;

          <title>So You Want To Buy a Dog?</title>

          <guid>https://arjunyadav.xyz/blog/so-you-want-to-buy-a-dog/</guid>
          <description>&lt;html lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-top: 1em&quot;&gt;dog lovers of the world, read my work. here i write my frustration about modern breding practices and idiot dog owners. i hope this work will help you in making better decison regarding dogs in future.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt; unfortunate times
&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-top: 1em&quot;&gt;as rule of thumb when you
combine dumb people with free markets it results into
degradation of commodities. music which previously nourished
the soul of it&amp;rsquo;s listeners has now been degraded to
simply stimulus noise. just see the top trending music these
days. now dogs are also getting freely traded in the market.
what happened with music also happened with dogs. the dogs
which previously protected the house of it&amp;rsquo;s owner are
now degraded to clowns for Instagram. or the dogs which were
previously bred for work are now (mostly) being bred for
looks, only looks. and the only reason why dogs are getting
bred for looks is the market. the market, especially the
dumb section of it decides to buy dogs only because they
look good. that forces the dog breeders to breed dogs for
looks.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-top: 1em&quot;&gt;effect of breeding dog for mere
looks on different dog breeds:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-top: 1em&quot;&gt;1- german shepherds which were
initially bred for courage, intelligence and muscular
strength now being destroyed because of the poor breeding of
this dog now german shepherds have problems including: hip
dysplasia[1] (decease caused by the demand for sloped back
german shepherds) and shyness.(because who cares about the
mental health of their german shepherd until he looks
good)&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-top: 1em&quot;&gt;2-Chihuahuas are bred for their
large head in relationship to the body. because of that:
&amp;quot;Chihuahua puppies have to be born through cesareans,
because the puppy&amp;rsquo;s heads are too big for natural
birth. There are also instances of open fontanels
(&amp;quot;Chihuahua molera&amp;quot;), which is seen as a breed
characteristic.&amp;quot;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-top: 1em&quot;&gt;3- forget about diseases which
have been resulted due to poor breeding. breeds like
bulldogs can&amp;rsquo;t even mate naturally!!!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-top: 1em&quot;&gt;the examples of poor breeding
can include any dog breed in the market. every single breed
is affected by this.[2]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt; lesson learned
&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-top: 1em&quot;&gt;don&amp;rsquo;t buy a dog just
because it looks good. see your requirements i.e size of
your house, the amount of time you will be spending with the
dog, the job for which you want the dog whether it&amp;rsquo;s
for personal protection or live stock guarding, check if it
matches with the breed you want to buy. it often happens
that people buy the wrong breed for a particular job. i know
few people who bought a pit bull as a live stock guardian,
and as expected results were terrifying. taking pit bull as
LGD is like giving wolves the responsibility of guarding the
sheep.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;dog vs toy dog
&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-top: 1em&quot;&gt;a dog is one who gets food
because he does some work. whether it&amp;rsquo;s protection of
house or live stock or maybe working at border and so on. on
the other hand toy dog is one who gets food only because he
looks good. a dog has to work, a toy dog has to merely
exist.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#x2F;pix&#x2F;dogvstoydog.jpg&gt;&lt;img class=resmid src=&quot;&#x2F;pix&#x2F;dogvstoydog.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;dog&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;the best breeder in the world
&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-top: 1em&quot;&gt;natural selection is the best
breeder. and where it can be found? in the native breeds of
your country. i&amp;rsquo;m here only talking about those native
dogs who have the least human intervention in their
breeding. i.e no poor selective breeding. every country has
their native breeds. if possible go for them. there are
multiple good reasons for that. first of all nature has made
them according to the local environment, so that the chances
of putting a dog made for cold weather into a hot
environment can be eliminated.(there are many idiots who are
breeding huskies in thar desert, India. secondly, as native
dogs are made by the nature they are more healthy than those
fancy toy dogs. it will save you a good chunk of money which
you would have spent on your dog&amp;rsquo;s diagnosis. third,
native breeds are way more cheaper than those fancy ones,
and often you can just get them for free, if you know where
to go.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-top: 1em&quot;&gt;but be aware that there are also
many local breeders who do poor breeding of native breeds.
it would be a good idea to get a native puppy from the
villages where the only breeder is natural selection. and
natural selection is the only breeder which can be
trusted.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <title>Selling unfinished products is new normal</title>

          <guid>https://arjunyadav.xyz/blog/selling-unfinished-products-is-new-normal/</guid>
          <description>&lt;html lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;p&gt;recently i decided to buy a new cycle for me. i choose to buy it from decathlon. the cheapest one. they provide good quality cycles, at least that&#x27;s what everyone said. so after deciding what i want to buy and from whom, i went to their store. rode it for a while in the store to check if everything is working fine before paying them. everything was fine, almost. there were parts missing. a lot of parts were missing from that cycle, no mudguard, there was option for water bottle holder but i can see no holder attached to it. no bell, not even cycle stand can be found on it! i thought they will assemble everything at checkout service. that these are just unfinished products. was i wrong? i was.
&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;at checkout:
&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I: how much is the price again?&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
salesman: 5k&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
I: OK i&#x27;m making the payment, you tell them to assemble it.
salesman: assemble? it&#x27;s already assembled.&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
I: i&#x27;m talking about the parts like mudguard, ring, stand and others
salesman: sir, they are accessories.&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
I: accessories? stand is a accessory? do you want me to just drop my cycle on the road while i go to some store? stand is not a accessory but a necessity!&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
salesman: if you want the accessories we can add them.&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
I: and how much will they cost me?&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
salesman: mudguard is for rs500, water bottle holder is for rs200, water bottle is for rs200, bell is for rs200, seat cover is for rs150, stand is for rs500...your total will be  rs6200&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
I: a stand for rs500, in the market it costs only rs150 to buy it!&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
salesman: it is what it is. &lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
I: if the complete product costs 6200 then why are you claiming it to be for 5000?&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
salesman: umm..ahhh...company decides it...
&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;&#x2F;pix&#x2F;soycle.jpg&quot; class=&quot;resmid&quot;&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;understanding the problem&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;cycle industry is the case of monopolistic competition. decathlon is not the only company selling cycles. there are other competitors like hero, atlas, Firefox and many more. they do not sell completely identical products but at the end they are just cycles with different marketing groups. charging only rs500 more than the competitor can lead the costumer to choose the other brand. this is cut throat competition.
&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;hence to fight competition companies have these three options:
&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;first,is to charge lower price to attract costumers. but it has the downside that it will reduce the companies&#x27;s profit even more and company may also has to incur loss because in competition companies already earn only average revenue. average revenue is just enough for the survival for the company. reducing average revenue by lowering the prices will be a sure recipe to enter into company closure.
&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;second, do better marketing than the competition. make people see beautiful imaginary lands in the company logo like the devotes see god in murti (statue) which are made up of stones. something which the apple has successfully done. but only if it was that easy to build brand image like apple every company would have done it.
&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;third, &quot;the necessary result of this competition is a general deterioration of commodities, adulteration, fake production and universal poisoning.&quot;(karl marx) so if reducing the price will lead to loss and brand image building is easier said then done, then why not just use inferior raw materials to reduce cost and earn surplus profit. but making inferior quality products and selling them to costumers does not work in long run. as the saying goes: you can fool some of the people all the time, some of the people some of the time, but can&#x27;t fool all the people all the time. costumers in long run can find which product is good for price and which is not. so this option does&#x27;t work either.
&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;the fourth way: my way or highway&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the companies have found the most evil solution.
to understand this solution.&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
we must first review the problems from the perspective of the cycle companies: &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1- if they increase price they will loose consumer.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2- if they decrease price they will loose profit.
&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;so if the price is the only problem then why not just reduce the price and still earn profit.
how?&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
by reducing the product.&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
how to reduce product?&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
remove the mudguard etc. and it will lower the price. consumer is fool. he will think that our cycle is cheaper than the other and fall in the trap of buying it.
&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and, company will reduce the price of this unfinished product so much that it will earn only minimal profit.
&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but then what&#x27;s the point of selling unfinished product if the company earns only minimal profit?&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
the unfinished product (cycle) is just a trap. the company will earn surplus profit from it&#x27;s accessories. company will overcharge on it&#x27;s accessories. the cycle will be reduced to only an instrument by which the company will sell the overpriced accessories. once the costumer buys unfinished cycle the cycle company gets monopoly over it&#x27;s accessories which enables the company to overcharge for it&#x27;s accessories. and earn surplus profit by exploiting it&#x27;s costumers without letting them know.
&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;this technique of selling unfinished products at lower price than competition and then earning surplus profit from accessories is not limited to only cycle industry. we can see the same happening in car, motorbike industry too. everywhere the basic price to acquire a product is reasonable but when price of accessories are added to them, the products turns out to be overpriced. that&#x27;s why car accessories are overpriced, because the company earns more profit from it&#x27;s accessories than the real product.(car)
&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;company likes to call them accessories but in reality they are necessities. and the company know this. it knows without these necessities their product is useless so the costumers will have to buy the overpriced accessories in order to use the product.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
